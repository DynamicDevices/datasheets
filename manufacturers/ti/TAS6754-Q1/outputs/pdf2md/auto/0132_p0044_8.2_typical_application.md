**Figure 8-1: Typical 4-Channel BTL Application Schematic**

This diagram shows the complete schematic for a typical 4-channel BTL (Bridge-Tied Load) application using the TAS6754-Q1 audio amplifier. The schematic includes:

* **Main IC:** TAS6754-Q1 positioned centrally with all pin connections shown
* **Power Supply Section:** Input power connections with filtering and decoupling capacitors
* **Audio Input Stage:** Digital audio interface connections (I2S/TDM)
* **Control Interface:** I2C communication lines for device configuration
* **Output Stage:** Four BTL output channels with output filtering components
* **Load Connections:** Speaker connections for each of the 4 channels
* **Passive Components:** Various capacitors, resistors, and inductors for filtering, biasing, and stability
* **Protection Circuitry:** Components for overcurrent, overvoltage, and thermal protection

The schematic demonstrates the recommended component values, placement, and connections for optimal performance in automotive audio applications.
