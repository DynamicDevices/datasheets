# 7.4.4 Warning Events

## 7.4.3.1.4 VBAT Undervoltage Fault

When the VBAT supply rail falls below nominal range, a VBAT Undervoltage Fault event is created and the device enters into Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) state. Once VBAT rises back up into nominal range, the fault event is cleared.

## 7.4.3.1.5 PVDD Overvoltage Fault

When the PVDD supply rail rises above nominal range, a PVDD Overvoltage Fault event is created and the device enters into Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) state. Once PVDD falls back down into nominal range, the fault event is cleared.

## 7.4.3.1.6 PVDD Undervoltage Fault

When the PVDD supply rail falls below nominal range, a PVDD Undervoltage Fault event is created and the device enters into Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) state. Once PVDD rises back up into nominal range, the fault event is cleared.

## 7.4.3.2 Overtemperature Shutdown (OTSD) Event

Section Overtemperature Shutdown describes the circumstances under which the device creates an OTSD event as well as the configurable recovery behavior.

## 7.4.3.3 Overcurrent Limit Fault Event

Section Overcurrent Limit (Cycle-By-Cycle) describes the circumstances under which the device creates an Overcurrent Limit Fault event. This is a transient event that only lasts for a limited time.

## 7.4.3.4 Overcurrent Shutdown Event

Section Overcurrent Protection describes the circumstances under which the device creates an OCSD event.

As Overcurrent Shutdown (OCSD) Event is a transient event and is not reported in a status register. The latched OCSD events are reported in Channel Overcurrent and DC Detection Fault Memory Register. Affected channels are placed in FAULT state.

## 7.4.3.5 DC Fault Event

Section DC Detect describes the circumstances under which the device creates an DC Fault event.

A DC Fault Event is a transient event and is not reported in a status register. The latched DC Fault events are reported in Channel Overcurrent and DC Detection Fault Memory Register. Affected channels are placed in FAULT state.

## 7.4.3.6 Clock Error Event

The Clock Rates section describes the supported Audio Data Formats, Bit Depths, and Clock Rates. If these conditions are violated or the clock is halted, the device reports a Clock Error Fault event and the device gracefully transitions to the AUTOREC state. After audio clock recovery, the device automatically returns to the previous state.

A Clock Error Event is a transient event and is not reported in a status register.

## 7.4.3.7 Charge Pump Fault Event

Section Charge Pump describes the circumstances under which the device creates an charge pump fault event as well as the recovery behavior.

## 7.4.4.1 Overtemperature Warning Event

Section Overtemperature Warning describes the circumstances under which the device creates a Overtemperature Warning event.
