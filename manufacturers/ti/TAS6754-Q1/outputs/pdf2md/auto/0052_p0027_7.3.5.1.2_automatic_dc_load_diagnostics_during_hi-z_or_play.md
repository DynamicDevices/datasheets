# 7.3.5.1.2 Automatic DC load diagnostics during Hi-Z or PLAY

During Hi-Z or PLAY states, automatic DC load diagnostics can be enabled to monitor the DC load current on each output channel. This feature helps detect short circuits, open loads, or other abnormal load conditions.

The DC load diagnostic is performed by measuring the current flowing through the output stage. The measurement results are compared against programmable thresholds to determine if the load condition is within acceptable limits.

## Key Features

- Automatic monitoring during Hi-Z or PLAY operation
- Programmable current thresholds for fault detection
- Individual channel monitoring capability
- Real-time fault status reporting

## Operation

When enabled, the DC load diagnostic circuitry continuously monitors the output current on each channel. If the measured current falls outside the programmed threshold range, a fault condition is flagged and can trigger an interrupt or be read from the status registers.

This diagnostic capability allows the system to detect:

- **Short circuit conditions:** When output current exceeds the upper threshold
- **Open load conditions:** When output current falls below the lower threshold
- **Abnormal load impedance:** When the load characteristic deviates from expected values

The diagnostic results can be used for system protection, error reporting, or adaptive control strategies.
