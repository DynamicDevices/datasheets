# 7.3.7.4 GPIO Pins

General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins provide flexible digital I/O capabilities. These pins can be configured individually as inputs or outputs and support various features including pull-up/pull-down resistors, interrupt generation, and alternate functions.

## Pin Configuration

GPIO pins are configured through a set of control registers that determine their operating mode, electrical characteristics, and alternate functions. Each pin can be independently configured without affecting other pins in the same port.

### Operating Modes

- **Input Mode**: Pin is configured to read external digital signals
- **Output Mode**: Pin is configured to drive digital signals to external circuits
- **Alternate Function Mode**: Pin is connected to an internal peripheral (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C)
- **Analog Mode**: Pin is connected to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) or other analog peripheral

### Electrical Characteristics

GPIO pins support the following electrical configurations:

- **Pull-up Resistor**: Internal resistor pulls the pin to VDD when not driven
- **Pull-down Resistor**: Internal resistor pulls the pin to GND when not driven
- **No Pull**: Pin floats when not driven (high impedance)
- **Open-drain**: Output stage allows only pull-down capability
- **Push-pull**: Output stage can drive both high and low levels

### Interrupt Capability

GPIO pins can generate interrupts on various edge and level conditions:

- Rising edge detection
- Falling edge detection
- Both edges detection
- High level detection
- Low level detection

Interrupt configuration is performed through dedicated interrupt control registers, allowing each pin to be individually enabled or disabled as an interrupt source.
