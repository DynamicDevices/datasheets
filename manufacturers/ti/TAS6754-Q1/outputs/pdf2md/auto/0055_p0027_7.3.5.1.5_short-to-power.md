# 7.3.5.1.5 Short-to-Power

A short-to-power fault occurs when an output pin is shorted to a voltage source higher than the device's supply voltage (V<sub>DD</sub>). This condition can potentially damage the device if not properly handled. The device includes built-in protection mechanisms to detect and manage short-to-power conditions.

## Detection Mechanism

The device monitors the output voltage on each pin. When the output voltage exceeds a predefined threshold above V<sub>DD</sub>, the device identifies this as a potential short-to-power fault. The detection circuitry continuously monitors for this condition during normal operation.

## Protection Features

When a short-to-power fault is detected, the device implements the following protection measures:

- **Current Limiting**: The output driver automatically limits the current flowing through the shorted pin to prevent damage to the internal circuitry.
- **Fault Reporting**: The fault condition is reported through the device's status registers, allowing the system controller to take appropriate action.
- **Output Disable**: Depending on the configuration, the device may automatically disable the affected output to prevent further stress on the device.

## Diagnostic Capabilities

The device provides diagnostic capabilities to help identify and troubleshoot short-to-power faults:

- Fault status can be read from dedicated status registers
- Individual pin fault status is available for isolated fault identification
- Fault conditions can trigger interrupt signals to alert the system controller

## Recovery Procedure

To recover from a short-to-power fault:

1. Clear the fault condition by removing the external short
2. Read and clear the fault status registers
3. Re-enable the affected output if it was automatically disabled
4. Monitor the output to ensure normal operation has resumed
