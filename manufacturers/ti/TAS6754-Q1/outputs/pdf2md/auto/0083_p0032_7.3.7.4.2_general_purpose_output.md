# 7.3.7.4.2 General Purpose Output

When configured as a general purpose output, the GPIO pin can be driven either high or low by writing to the corresponding bit in the GPIO Data Output Register (GPIO_DOUT). The output value is controlled by software and remains at the programmed level until changed.

## Output Configuration

To configure a GPIO pin as a general purpose output:

- Set the corresponding bit in the GPIO Mode Register (GPIO_MODE) to output mode
- Write the desired output value (0 or 1) to the corresponding bit in GPIO_DOUT
- The pin will drive the programmed logic level

## Output Control

The output state of GPIO pins can be controlled through the following registers:

- **GPIO_DOUT** - Direct write to set output values
- **GPIO_DOUT_SET** - Write 1 to set corresponding output bits high (atomic set operation)
- **GPIO_DOUT_CLR** - Write 1 to clear corresponding output bits low (atomic clear operation)
- **GPIO_DOUT_TGL** - Write 1 to toggle corresponding output bits (atomic toggle operation)

The atomic set, clear, and toggle registers provide a convenient way to modify individual GPIO outputs without read-modify-write sequences, which is useful in interrupt handlers or multi-threaded applications.

## Drive Strength

The output drive strength can be configured to control the current capability of the GPIO pin. Higher drive strength settings allow the pin to drive larger capacitive loads or provide faster edge rates, but may increase power consumption and electromagnetic emissions.

Refer to the GPIO Drive Strength Configuration section for details on available drive strength settings.
