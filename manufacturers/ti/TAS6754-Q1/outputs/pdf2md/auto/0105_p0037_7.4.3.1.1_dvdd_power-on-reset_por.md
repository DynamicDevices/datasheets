# 7.4.3.1.1 DVDD Power-On-Reset (POR)

The DVDD Power-On-Reset (POR) monitors the DVDD supply voltage and generates a reset signal when the voltage is below the POR threshold. The POR circuit ensures that the device remains in reset until DVDD reaches a safe operating level.

## POR Threshold and Hysteresis

The DVDD POR has a rising threshold and falling threshold with hysteresis to prevent oscillation during power supply ramp-up or brownout conditions.

- **Rising Threshold (VPOR_RISING)**: The voltage level at which the POR is released during power-up
- **Falling Threshold (VPOR_FALLING)**: The voltage level at which the POR is asserted during power-down or brownout
- **Hysteresis**: The difference between the rising and falling thresholds provides noise immunity

## POR Operation

During power-up:
1. When DVDD is below the POR rising threshold, the device is held in reset
2. As DVDD rises above the POR rising threshold, the POR circuit releases the reset after a short delay
3. The device begins normal operation once all reset conditions are cleared

During brownout or power-down:
1. If DVDD falls below the POR falling threshold, the POR immediately asserts a reset
2. The device remains in reset until DVDD rises above the POR rising threshold again

## Reset Delay

After the DVDD voltage crosses the POR rising threshold, there is an internal delay before the reset is released. This delay allows internal circuits and oscillators to stabilize before normal operation begins.
