# 8.3.2 Layout Example

- Decoupling capacitors, G, at PLL_BYP, VR_DIG_BYP, VR_DIG_RET, AVDD_BYP, AVDD_RET, VREG_BYP, VREG_RET, GVDD_BYP, DVDD, are placed on the same layer with device, without affecting the return path from the LC filter, D.

- PVDD supply trace, H, is suggested to be placed on an internal layer, and symmetrical to the channels on both sides of the device.

- Device output trace, I, is suggested to be placed on an internal layer, and symmetrical on both sides of the device.

**Figure 8-2: TAS6754-Q1 Layout Top Example**

This figure shows a PCB layout example for the TAS6754-Q1 device, illustrating the recommended placement and routing of critical components and traces:

- The layout demonstrates the top layer view of the device
- Shows the placement of decoupling capacitors (G) at various bypass and retention pins including PLL_BYP, VR_DIG_BYP, VR_DIG_RET, AVDD_BYP, AVDD_RET, VREG_BYP, VREG_RET, GVDD_BYP, and DVDD
- Illustrates the LC filter return path (D) configuration
- Displays the PVDD supply trace routing (H) with symmetrical placement relative to the device channels
- Shows the device output trace routing (I) with symmetrical placement on both sides of the device
- Demonstrates proper separation and organization of power, ground, and signal traces for optimal performance
