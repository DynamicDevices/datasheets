# 7.3.7.1 FAULT Pin

The FAULT pin is an open-drain output that indicates a fault condition. When a fault occurs, the FAULT pin is pulled low. The FAULT pin requires an external pull-up resistor to operate properly.

The FAULT pin will assert low under the following conditions:

- Thermal shutdown (TSD)
- Overcurrent protection (OCP)
- Undervoltage lockout (UVLO)
- Overvoltage protection (OVP)

When any fault condition is detected, the device enters a fault state and the FAULT pin is asserted low. The device attempts to restart automatically after the fault condition is cleared, following the soft-start sequence.

## Fault Pin Behavior

The FAULT pin provides real-time fault status indication. When multiple faults occur simultaneously, the FAULT pin remains asserted low until all fault conditions are cleared.

### Fault Recovery

After a fault condition is cleared, the device implements an automatic restart sequence:

- The fault condition must be removed
- The device waits for the fault recovery time
- Soft-start sequence is initiated
- Normal operation resumes if no faults are present

The FAULT pin is released (returns to high impedance) once the device successfully completes the restart sequence and enters normal operation mode.
