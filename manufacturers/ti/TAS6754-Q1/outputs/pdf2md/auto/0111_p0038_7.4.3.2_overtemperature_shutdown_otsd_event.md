# 7.4.3.2 Overtemperature Shutdown (OTSD) Event

An Overtemperature Shutdown (OTSD) event occurs when the junction temperature of the device exceeds the OTSD threshold. This is a critical protection mechanism to prevent damage to the device due to excessive heat.

## OTSD Behavior

When an OTSD event is detected:

- The device immediately shuts down all power outputs
- All MOSFETs are turned off
- The device enters a thermal shutdown state
- Normal operation cannot resume until the junction temperature falls below the OTSD recovery threshold

## OTSD Thresholds

The typical OTSD threshold and hysteresis values are:

- **OTSD Threshold:** Junction temperature at which shutdown occurs
- **OTSD Hysteresis:** Temperature difference between shutdown and recovery thresholds
- **Recovery:** Device can restart only after temperature drops below (OTSD threshold - hysteresis)

## OTSD Recovery

After an OTSD event:

1. The device remains in shutdown state while temperature is above the recovery threshold
2. Once the junction temperature falls below the recovery threshold, the device can be re-enabled
3. The host system may need to re-initialize the device depending on the configuration
4. It is recommended to investigate and address the root cause of the overtemperature condition before resuming normal operation

## Recommendations

To prevent OTSD events:

- Ensure adequate thermal design and heatsinking
- Monitor junction temperature during operation
- Verify PCB layout follows thermal management guidelines
- Consider derating power output in high ambient temperature environments
- Implement thermal monitoring and proactive throttling in the system software
