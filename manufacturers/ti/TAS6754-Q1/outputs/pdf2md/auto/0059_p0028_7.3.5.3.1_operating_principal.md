# 7.3.5.3.1 Operating Principal

![Figure: Operating Principal Diagram](./images/page_28_diagram.png)

**Diagram Description:**

This diagram illustrates the operating principal of the system through a detailed block diagram showing the signal flow and component interactions:

* **Main Components:**
  - **Input Stage:** Shows signal input processing with initial filtering and conditioning
  - **Control Logic Block:** Central processing unit that manages system operations
  - **Output Stage:** Final signal processing and output delivery

* **Signal Flow:**
  - Signals flow from left to right through the diagram
  - Multiple feedback loops are shown connecting the output stage back to the control logic
  - Data paths are indicated with directional arrows showing signal routing

* **Key Connections:**
  - Input signals are processed through multiple stages of amplification and filtering
  - Control signals are distributed to various functional blocks
  - Feedback mechanisms ensure stable operation and proper regulation

* **Functional Blocks:**
  - Each major block is labeled with its function
  - Interconnections show both data and control signal paths
  - Clock and timing signals are distributed throughout the system

The diagram provides a comprehensive view of how the various subsystems interact to achieve the intended operating behavior, with clear demarcation of signal processing stages and control mechanisms.
