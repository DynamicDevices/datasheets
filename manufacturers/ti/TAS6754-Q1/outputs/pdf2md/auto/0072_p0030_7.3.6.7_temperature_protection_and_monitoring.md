# 7.3.6.7 Temperature Protection and Monitoring

The device monitors temperature with five temperature sensors. Every output channel has a temperature sensor in close proximity to the center of the output channels output stage to monitor the temperature of each channel separately. An additional temperature sensor is located in a global position on the die, this better represents the actual die junction temperature. Based on these sensors, warning and fault signals can be generated. A Thermal Gain Foldback scheme is available that autonomously regulates audio gain and consequently limits die temperature.

**Figure 7-17: Abstract Temperature Sensor Locations Within the Device**

This diagram illustrates the physical placement of temperature sensors across the TAS6754-Q1 device:

- **Channel-specific sensors (OT1, OT2, OT3, OT4)**: Four temperature sensors are positioned in close proximity to each of the four output channels (CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4). Each sensor (labeled OT with channel number) is located near the FETs (output stage transistors) of its respective channel to monitor local die temperature.

- **Global sensor (OTGlobal)**: A fifth temperature sensor is centrally located on the die to monitor the overall junction temperature. This sensor provides a more representative measurement of the actual die junction temperature.

- **Layout**: The diagram shows the four channels arranged in a rectangular configuration with:
  - CH4 (OT4 + FETs) in the upper left
  - CH2 (OT2 + FETs) in the upper right
  - CH3 (OT3 + FETs) in the lower left
  - CH1 (OT1 + FETs) in the lower right
  - OTGlobal positioned centrally between all channels

This sensor arrangement enables both channel-specific thermal monitoring and protection, as well as global die temperature oversight.

## 7.3.6.7.1 Overtemperature Shutdown

The temperature thresholds for global OTSD and for overtemperature shutdowns generated by the output channels, OTSD(i) are set to fixed values. Refer to Section 5.5 for the nominal temperature and recovery hysteresis values.

**Global OTSD**: If the global junction temperature rises above the OTSD threshold, all channels are placed into a protective shutdown state and an Overtemperature Shutdown (OTSD) Event is created.

**Channel-specific OTSD**: If the junction temperature of a channel rises above the OTSD threshold, the affected channel is put into a protective state and an Overtemperature Shutdown (OTSD) Event is created.

The tolerance of the warning levels and OTSD temperatures track each other.

By default, a fault signal generates an active low signal on the FAULT Pin when an OTSD event occurs.
