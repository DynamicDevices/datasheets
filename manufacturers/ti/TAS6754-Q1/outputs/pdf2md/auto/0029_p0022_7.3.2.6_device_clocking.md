# 7.3.2.6 Device Clocking

The TAS6754-Q1 has a flexible clocking system. Internally, the device requires several additional clocks, mostly at related clock rates to function correctly. All of these clocks can be derived from the Serial Audio Interface.

Figure 7-12 shows the basic data flow and clock distribution.

**Figure 7-12. Audio Flow with Respective Clocks**

This block diagram illustrates the internal clock distribution and audio data flow in the TAS6754-Q1:

- **Input Signals:** SCLK, FSYNC, and SDIN enter the Serial Audio Interface (Input) block
- **Clock Generation and Distribution:**
  - DSPCLK: Clock for the DSP (including interpolation) block
  - OSRCLK: Oversampling rate clock for the Delta Sigma Modulator
  - DACCLK: Clock for the DAC block
- **Signal Processing Chain:**
  - Serial Audio Interface (Input) receives the input signals
  - DSP block performs digital signal processing including interpolation
  - Delta Sigma Modulator converts the digital signal
  - DAC outputs the final analog signal
- The diagram shows the device internal clock domain (indicated by dashed border) and the flow of clocks to each processing block

The Serial Audio Interface typically has 3 connection pins which are listed as follows:

- SCLK (Audio Serial Clock)
- FSYNC (Frame Sync in TDM or Left/Right in I²S)
- SDIN (Input Data). In TDM mode, a single SDIN is used while I²S requires two SDIN pins to provide audio data for 4 channels
- Optional: SDOUT for outgoing data transmission. Up to two SDOUT pins can be configured

The device has an internal PLL which uses SCLK as reference clock and creates the higher rate clocks required by the DSP and the DAC clock.

The TAS6754-Q1 has an audio sampling rate detection circuit that automatically senses the sampling frequency. Common audio sampling frequencies of 44.1kHz – 48kHz, 88.2kHz – 96kHz and 192kHz are supported. The sampling frequency detector sets the clock for DAC and DSP automatically.

## 7.3.2.6.1 Clock Rates

The serial audio interface port is a 3-wire serial port with the signals SCLK, FSYNC and SDIN_1 as well as an optional SDIN_2 in I²S Mode.

SCLK is the serial audio bit clock used to clock the serial data present on SDIN_x into the serial shift register of the audio interface. Serial data is clocked into the TAS6754-Q1 device with SCLK.

The FSYNC pin is the serial audio left/right word clock or frame sync when the device is operated in TDM Mode.

SDIN_1 is the TDM data input. In I²S mode, SDIN_1 is the data input for channels 1 and 2 and a GPIO pin needs to be configured as SDIN_2 to receive the data input for channels 3 and 4.

| Format | Data Bits | Maximum FSYNC Frequency (kHz) | SCLK Rate (fs) |
|--------|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------|
| I²S / LJ | 32, 24, 20, 16 | 44.1 to 192 | x64, x32 |
|  |  | 44.1 / 48 | x128, x256, x512 |
| TDM | 32, 24, 20, 16 | 96 | x128, x256 |
|  |  | 192 | x128 |

## 7.3.2.6.2 Clock Halt Auto-recovery

Certain host processors halt the audio clock when no audio is playing. When the clock is halted, the device puts all channels into the Hi-Z state and issues a latched error report. The transition to Hi-Z occurs gracefully by holding the last received sample from the audio interface and ramping down the volume. This behavior can be
