**Figure 7-14. Low Latency and Audio Signal Path**

This diagram illustrates the Low Latency and Audio Signal Path architecture of the TAS6754-Q1:

**Input Source:**
- TDM Audio Source (e.g., Tuner, DSP, SoC) provides the main audio input
- ANC/RNC Noise cancellation signal provides time-sensitive audio

**TDM8 Signal Structure:**
The example TDM8 signal table shows:
- 8 slots numbered 1-8
- Signal allocation: Audio Ch1, Audio Ch2, Audio Ch3, Audio Ch4, LL Ch1, LL Ch2, LL Ch3, LL Ch4
- LL channels are designated for Low Latency paths

**Signal Path:**
- SDIN_1 input carries the TDM signal
- CHANNEL 1 and LL CHANNEL 1 are summed (mixer) → OUTPUT 1
- CHANNEL 2 and LL CHANNEL 2 are summed (mixer) → OUTPUT 2
- CHANNEL 3 and LL CHANNEL 3 are summed (mixer) → OUTPUT 3
- CHANNEL 4 and LL CHANNEL 4 are summed (mixer) → OUTPUT 4

**Output Stage:**
All mixed signals pass through a common Output Stage block that drives the four outputs (OUTPUT 1 through OUTPUT 4).

The architecture allows time-sensitive signals (LL channels) to be mixed with standard audio channels before amplification, enabling low-latency processing for applications like active noise cancellation.

## 7.3.3.7 Full Feature Low Latency Path

In addition to the Low Latency Signal Path the TAS6754-Q1 integrates a Full Feature Low Latency Path. Using the Full Feature Low Latency Path the time-sensitive audio signals, such as active noise cancellation (ANC) or road noise cancellation (RNC), can be premixed and do not need to be separated from the non-time-sensitive audio data. The premixed audio data is processed through the DSP and then amplified at the output stage with a lower group delay.

**Figure 7-15. Full Feature Low Latency and Audio Signal Path**

*(Note: This figure is referenced in the text but appears to be included in the same diagram image as Figure 7-14, showing the alternative Full Feature Low Latency path architecture)*

The Full Feature Low Latency path shows:

**Input Source:**
- TDM Audio Source (e.g., Tuner, DSP, SoC)

**TDM Signal Structure:**
The example TDM signal table shows:
- 4 slots numbered 1-4
- Signal allocation: Audio Ch1 + ANC/RNC Ch1, Audio Ch1 + ANC/RNC Ch2, Audio Ch1 + ANC/RNC Ch3, Audio Ch1 + ANC/RNC Ch4
- Audio and ANC/RNC signals are premixed in the TDM slots

**Signal Processing:**
- SDIN_1 input carries the premixed TDM signal
- DSP block processes "Audio data processed with all enabled DSP features"
- Output Stage amplifies the processed signals

**Outputs:**
- OUTPUT 1
- OUTPUT 2
- OUTPUT 3
- OUTPUT 4

This architecture allows time-sensitive ANC/RNC signals to be premixed with standard audio before DSP processing, providing full DSP feature access while maintaining lower group delay.

## 7.3.4 Class-D operation and Spread Spectrum Control

### 7.3.4.1 1L Modulation

TAS6754-Q1 supports 1L modulation. With 1L modulation, the OUT_xP side switches from 0 volts to the supply voltage at the switching frequency (Fsw). The OUT_xM side switches from 0 volts to the supply voltage at the
