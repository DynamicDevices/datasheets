# 7.3.2.6.3 Sample Rate on the Fly Change

The sample rate can be changed on the fly without stopping the data stream. This is useful for applications that need to dynamically adjust the sample rate based on changing conditions or requirements.

To change the sample rate on the fly:

1. Write the new sample rate configuration to the appropriate registers while data streaming is active
2. The new sample rate will take effect after the current conversion cycle completes
3. No data loss or glitches will occur during the transition

**Note:** When changing the sample rate during active streaming, ensure that the new rate is compatible with the current filter and decimation settings to avoid unexpected behavior.
