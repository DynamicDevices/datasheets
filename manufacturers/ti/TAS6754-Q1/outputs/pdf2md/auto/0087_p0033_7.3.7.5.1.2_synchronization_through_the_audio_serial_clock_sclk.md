# 7.3.7.5.1.2 Synchronization through the audio serial clock (SCLK)

The audio serial clock (SCLK) can be used to synchronize the internal audio data processing with an external clock source. This synchronization method is available when the I2S interface is configured in slave mode.

When enabled, the SCLK signal is used as the reference clock for the internal audio processing pipeline. This ensures that all audio data processing operations are synchronized with the external clock domain, preventing clock domain crossing issues and maintaining timing coherence across the system.

## Key Features

- Synchronization occurs through the SCLK pin when configured in slave mode
- Eliminates the need for additional clock domain crossing logic
- Maintains timing coherence between external and internal audio processing
- Reduces latency and jitter in the audio path

## Configuration Requirements

To enable synchronization through SCLK:

- Configure the I2S interface in slave mode
- Ensure the external SCLK frequency matches the required audio processing clock rate
- Enable the synchronization mechanism through the appropriate control registers
- Verify that timing constraints are met for the SCLK signal

## Benefits

- **Improved timing accuracy**: Direct synchronization with the external clock source
- **Reduced complexity**: No need for asynchronous FIFO buffers or complex clock domain crossing logic
- **Lower latency**: Direct clock relationship eliminates synchronization delays
- **Better audio quality**: Minimizes jitter and timing variations in the audio signal path
