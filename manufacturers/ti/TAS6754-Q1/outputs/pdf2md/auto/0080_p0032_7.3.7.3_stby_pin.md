# 7.3.7.3 STBY Pin

The STBY pin is used to control the standby mode of the device. When the STBY pin is asserted, the device enters a low-power standby state where most internal circuits are disabled to minimize power consumption.

## Standby Mode Operation

When the STBY pin is pulled low (logic 0), the device enters standby mode. In this mode:

- Internal regulators are disabled
- Output drivers are tri-stated
- Power consumption is minimized
- Configuration registers retain their values

To exit standby mode, the STBY pin must be pulled high (logic 1). The device will return to normal operation after the specified wake-up time.

## Timing Considerations

The device requires a minimum wake-up time after exiting standby mode before normal operation can resume. Refer to the timing specifications in the electrical characteristics section for the exact wake-up time requirements.
