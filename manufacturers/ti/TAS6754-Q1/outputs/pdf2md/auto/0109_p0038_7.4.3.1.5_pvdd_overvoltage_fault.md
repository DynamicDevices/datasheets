# 7.4.3.1.5 PVDD Overvoltage Fault

This fault occurs when the PVDD voltage exceeds the overvoltage threshold. The PVDD overvoltage threshold is typically set to protect the device from excessive supply voltage that could damage internal circuits.

When a PVDD overvoltage condition is detected:

- The device enters a safe state
- Power stages are disabled
- A fault flag is set in the status registers
- The NFAULT pin is asserted (pulled low) if enabled

The fault condition must be cleared by:

- Reducing the PVDD voltage below the overvoltage threshold
- Clearing the fault status register bits
- Issuing a fault reset command if required by the device configuration

The PVDD overvoltage threshold and hysteresis values are device-specific and can be found in the electrical characteristics section of the datasheet.
