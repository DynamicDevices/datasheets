# 8.2.2 Power Supply Recommendations

The power supply for the device must be well-regulated and capable of supplying sufficient current to support the application's power requirements. A low-noise power supply is recommended to minimize interference with the analog circuitry.

## Decoupling Capacitors

Proper decoupling is essential for optimal performance. Place decoupling capacitors as close as possible to the power supply pins of the device. The following guidelines should be followed:

- Use a combination of bulk and high-frequency decoupling capacitors
- Place a 10 µF bulk capacitor near the device
- Place a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor directly at each power pin
- Use low-ESR ceramic capacitors (X7R or X5R dielectric recommended)
- Keep PCB traces between capacitors and power pins as short as possible
- Use wide traces or power planes to minimize inductance

## Power Supply Sequencing

No specific power supply sequencing is required for this device. However, observe the following recommendations:

- Ensure all power supplies reach their nominal voltage within the specified ramp time
- Avoid applying input signals before power supplies are stable
- During power-down, allow supplies to discharge completely before re-applying power

## Power Supply Noise

Power supply noise can couple into sensitive analog circuits and degrade performance. To minimize noise:

- Use a dedicated analog power supply or linear regulator for analog sections
- Implement proper PCB layout techniques with separate analog and digital ground planes
- Use ferrite beads or filtering to isolate noisy digital supplies from analog circuits
- Avoid running high-speed digital signals near analog power traces

## Voltage Monitoring

For mission-critical applications, consider implementing power supply voltage monitoring to detect:

- Under-voltage conditions
- Over-voltage conditions
- Supply voltage droop during high current transients

This monitoring can trigger appropriate system responses such as reset, safe shutdown, or error logging.
