# 8.3.3 Thermal Considerations

The thermally enhanced PowerPAD package has an exposed pad up for connection to a heat sink. The output power of any amplifier is determined by the thermal performance of the amplifier as well as limitations placed on the amplifier by the system, such as the ambient operating temperature. The heat sink absorbs heat from the TAS6754-Q1 and transfers the heat to the air. With proper thermal management this process can reach equilibrium and heat can be continually transferred from the device. Heat sinks can be smaller than that of classic linear amplifier design because of the excellent efficiency of class-D amplifiers. This device is intended for use with a heat sink, therefore, RθJC is used as the thermal resistance from junction to the exposed metal package. This resistance dominates the thermal management, so other thermal transfers is not considered. The thermal resistance of RθJA (junction to ambient) is required to determine the full thermal design. The thermal resistance is comprised of the following components:

- RθJC of the TAS6754-Q1
- Thermal resistance of the thermal interface material
- Thermal resistance of the heat sink

This figure illustrates recommended PCB layout examples for the PVDD (power supply) and output traces of the TAS6754-Q1. The diagram shows proper trace routing, width, and placement considerations for optimal thermal and electrical performance in the amplifier design.
