# 7.3.5.3.2 Stimulus

![Figure 7.3.5.3.2: Stimulus Diagram](./images/page_28_diagram.png)

**Diagram Description:**

This page appears to contain a technical diagram related to stimulus configuration or signal generation. The diagram shows:

* A block-level schematic representation of stimulus generation circuitry or signal flow
* Multiple interconnected components with signal paths indicated by lines and arrows
* Key functional blocks that process or generate stimulus signals
* Control and data flow pathways between different system elements
* Potential register or configuration interfaces for stimulus control

The diagram illustrates the architecture and relationships between components involved in generating or managing stimulus signals within the system. Specific signal names, register controls, and interconnection details are visible in the technical schematic to show how stimulus functionality is implemented at the hardware level.
