# 7.4.4.2 Overcurrent Limit Warning Event

![Figure 7.4.4.2: Overcurrent Limit Warning Event Timing Diagram](./images/page_39_diagram.png)

**Timing Diagram Description:**

This timing diagram illustrates the Overcurrent Limit Warning Event sequence with the following key signals and behavior:

* **ILOAD (Load Current):** Shows the load current rising and crossing the overcurrent warning threshold (I_OC_WARN). The current continues to rise above this threshold, triggering the warning event.

* **OC_WARN (Overcurrent Warning Signal):** This digital signal transitions from LOW to HIGH when the load current exceeds the I_OC_WARN threshold, indicating that an overcurrent warning condition has been detected.

* **Time Relationships:** 
  - The diagram shows a propagation delay between when ILOAD crosses the I_OC_WARN threshold and when the OC_WARN signal asserts HIGH
  - The OC_WARN signal remains HIGH as long as the overcurrent condition persists
  - When ILOAD drops back below the threshold (with appropriate hysteresis), the OC_WARN signal returns to LOW

* **Key Threshold:** The horizontal dashed line represents I_OC_WARN, the programmable overcurrent warning threshold level.

This event provides an early warning mechanism to alert the system that the load current is approaching critical levels, allowing for preventive action before a hard overcurrent shutdown occurs.
