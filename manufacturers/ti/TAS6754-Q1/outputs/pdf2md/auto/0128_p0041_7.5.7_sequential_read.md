# 7.5.7 Sequential Read

A sequential data-read transfer is identical to a single-byte data-read transfer except that multiple data bytes are transmitted by the device to the controller device as shown in Figure 7-28. Except for the last data byte, the controller device responds with an acknowledge bit after receiving each data byte and automatically increments the I2C subaddress by one. After receiving the last data byte, the controller device transmits a not-acknowledge followed by a stop condition to complete the transfer.

**Figure 7-28 Description: Sequential Read Transfer**

This timing diagram illustrates the I2C sequential read transfer protocol, showing:

* **Start Condition** - Initiates the transfer
* **I2C Device Address and R/W Bit** - First transmission includes:
  - Address bits A7, A6, A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0
  - R/W bit = 0 (write operation for sending subaddress)
  - Followed by Acknowledge (ACK)
* **Subaddress** - Memory location address bits A7 through A0
  - Followed by Acknowledge (ACK)
* **Repeat Start Condition** - Repeated start without stop
* **I2C Device Address and R/W Bit** - Second transmission includes:
  - Same address bits A7, A6, A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0
  - R/W bit = 1 (read operation)
  - Followed by Acknowledge (ACK)
* **First Data Byte** - Data bits D7 through D0
  - Followed by Acknowledge (ACK) from controller
* **Other Data Byte(s)** - Additional data bytes D7 through D0
  - Each followed by Acknowledge (ACK) from controller
  - Subaddress automatically increments after each byte
* **Last Data Byte** - Final data byte D7 through D0
  - Followed by Not-Acknowledge (NACK) from controller
* **Stop Condition** - Terminates the transfer

The diagram shows the complete handshaking sequence with ACK bits between each phase, demonstrating how multiple sequential data bytes are read from incrementing memory addresses in a single I2C transaction.
