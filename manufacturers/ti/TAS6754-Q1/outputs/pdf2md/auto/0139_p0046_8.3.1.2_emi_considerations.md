# 8.3.1.2 EMI Considerations

Electromagnetic interference (EMI) is an important consideration in high-speed digital designs. Proper PCB layout techniques can significantly reduce EMI emissions and improve system reliability.

## Ground Plane Design

A solid ground plane is essential for minimizing EMI. The ground plane should be continuous and unbroken whenever possible. Avoid splitting the ground plane, as this can create current loops that radiate electromagnetic energy.

### Key Guidelines:

- Use a continuous ground plane on at least one layer of the PCB
- Minimize the use of ground plane splits or cutouts
- Ensure all ground connections have low impedance paths back to the source
- Place decoupling capacitors close to power pins with short traces to ground

## High-Speed Signal Routing

High-speed signals are particularly susceptible to generating EMI. Follow these best practices when routing high-speed traces:

- Keep trace lengths as short as possible
- Route high-speed signals on inner layers between ground planes when possible
- Use differential signaling for critical high-speed signals
- Avoid routing high-speed signals near board edges
- Maintain consistent trace impedance by controlling trace width and spacing

## Decoupling and Filtering

Proper decoupling is critical for both power supply stability and EMI reduction:

- Place decoupling capacitors as close as possible to IC power pins
- Use multiple capacitor values to cover a wide frequency range (e.g., 0.1µF, 0.01µF, 1000pF)
- Minimize the inductance of capacitor connections by using short, wide traces or vias
- Consider adding ferrite beads on power supply lines to filter high-frequency noise

## Shielding and Enclosure Design

In some cases, additional shielding may be required to meet EMI requirements:

- Use metal enclosures to contain radiated emissions
- Ensure proper grounding of shields and enclosures
- Use shielded cables for external connections when necessary
- Consider using EMI gaskets at enclosure seams for improved shielding effectiveness
