## 8.1 Application Information

The TAS6754-Q1 is a four-channel digital input Class-D audio-amplifier design with integrated real time Current Feedback and DSP for use in automotive head units and external amplifier modules. The TAS6754-Q1 incorporates the necessary functionality to perform in demanding automotive OEM applications.

## 8.1.1 Reconstruction Filter Design

The amplifier outputs are driven by high-current LDMOS transistors in an H-bridge configuration. The OUTP transistors are either fully off or fully on. The result is a square-wave output signal with a duty cycle that is proportional to the amplitude of the audio signal. An LC demodulation filter is used to recover the audio signal. The filter attenuates the high-frequency components of the output signals that are out of the audio band. The design of the demodulation filter significantly affects the audio performance of the power amplifier. Therefore, to meet the system THD+N requirements, carefully consider the selection of the inductors used in the output filter.
