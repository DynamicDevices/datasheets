# 7.3.5.4 Real-Time Load Diagnostics

Real-time load diagnostics provide continuous monitoring of output load conditions to detect faults such as open loads, short circuits, or overload conditions. This feature enables the system to quickly identify and respond to load anomalies.

## Key Features

- Continuous monitoring of load current
- Detection of open load conditions
- Detection of short circuit conditions
- Overload detection and protection
- Real-time status reporting via diagnostic registers

## Diagnostic Thresholds

The load diagnostic function compares the measured load current against programmable threshold values to determine the load status. These thresholds can be configured to match specific application requirements.

## Diagnostic Register Access

Load diagnostic status information is available through dedicated diagnostic registers. These registers provide real-time information about the current state of each output channel and can be read at any time during operation.

## Fault Response

When a load fault is detected, the device can be configured to:

- Set a fault flag in the diagnostic register
- Generate an interrupt signal (if enabled)
- Disable the affected output channel (if configured)
- Maintain normal operation and continue monitoring

The specific response to load faults is determined by the configuration settings in the control registers.
