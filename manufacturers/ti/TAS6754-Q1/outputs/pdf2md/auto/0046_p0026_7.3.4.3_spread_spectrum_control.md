# 7.3.4.3 Spread Spectrum Control

Spread spectrum clocking can be enabled to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) by spreading the clock frequency over a small range. This technique modulates the clock frequency slightly, which reduces peak emissions at specific frequencies.

## Configuration

To enable spread spectrum clocking, configure the appropriate control registers. The spread spectrum modulation typically affects the PLL output and can be adjusted for different modulation depths and rates.

### Key Parameters

- **Modulation Depth**: Controls how much the frequency varies from the center frequency
- **Modulation Rate**: Determines how quickly the frequency is modulated
- **Enable/Disable**: Allows spread spectrum to be turned on or off as needed

## Benefits

- Reduces peak EMI emissions by distributing energy across a frequency range
- Helps meet electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements
- Can be enabled or disabled based on system requirements

## Considerations

When enabling spread spectrum clocking, consider:

- Small frequency variation may affect timing-sensitive applications
- Verify that all connected devices can tolerate the frequency modulation
- Test EMI performance to ensure adequate reduction is achieved
