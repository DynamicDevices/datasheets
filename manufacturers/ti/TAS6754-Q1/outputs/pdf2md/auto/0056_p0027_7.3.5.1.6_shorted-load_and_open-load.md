# 7.3.5.1.6 Shorted-Load and Open-Load

The Shorted-Load (SL) test triggers a fault condition if the conductive path between the OUT_(i)M pin and OUT_(i)P pin of the tested channel (i) has an impedance below the threshold set. The SL test has a configurable threshold depending on the expected load to be connected. Because the speakers and cable impedance connected to each channel can be different, each channel can be assigned a unique threshold value.

The Open-Load (OL) test triggers a fault condition if the conductive path between the OUT_(i)M pin and OUT_(i)P pin of the tested channel (i) has an impedance higher than that specified in the Electrical Characteristics section.

### 7.3.5.1.1 Automatic DC Load Diagnostics at Device Initialization

The TAS6754-Q1 supports automatic and autonomous DC load diagnostics at device start-up. When leaving DEEP SLEEP state and under the condition that all power supplies are within the recommended operating range, the device transitions into SLEEP state and automatically starts DC load diagnostics on all four channels.

Neither I2C configuration nor any audio signals are necessary for the TAS6754-Q1 to perform short-to-power (S2P), short-to-ground (S2G), open-load (OL), and shorted-load (SL) tests based on default configuration. Systems can benefit from this autonomous operation because of the possibility to run the load diagnostics while bringing up the digital part of the audio chain.

### 7.3.5.1.2 Automatic DC load diagnostics during Hi-Z or PLAY

When a fault occurs while a channel is in Hi-Z or PLAY state, the device places the channel in either FAULT state or Auto Recovery State. After the fault is resolved or cleared, the device automatically runs DC load diagnostics on the affected channel and recover to previous Hi-Z respective PLAY state unless a different state was requested through I2C.

### 7.3.5.1.3 Manual start of DC load diagnostics

Manual DC load diagnostics can be enabled in any state after all power supplies are within the recommended operating range and after the device has transitioned to SLEEP state for the first time. DC diagnostics can be enabled manually by setting the I2C control state register to LOAD DIAG state to run on any or all channels. If either the STBY pin or a GPIO pin function set the device to SLEEP or DEEP SLEEP state, manual DC Load diagnostics cannot be run. This doesn't apply when the device is set to SLEEP or DEEP SLEEP state through I2C control, in which manual DC Load diagnostics are available.

### 7.3.5.1.4 Short-to-Ground

The Short-to-Ground (S2G) tests triggers a fault condition if there is a conductive path from output pin OUT_(i)M or OUT_(i)P of the tested channel (i) to GND with an impedance below that specified in the Electrical Characteristics section.

### 7.3.5.1.5 Short-to-Power

The Short-to-Power (S2P) tests triggers a fault condition if there is a conductive path from output pin OUT_(i)M or OUT_(i)P of the tested channel (i) to a power rail with an impedance below that specified in the Electrical Characteristics section.
