# 7.3.1.1 Power-Supply Sequence

In a typical system, the VBAT and PVDD supplies are both connected to the vehicle battery and power up at the same time.

## 7.3.1.1.1 Power-Up Sequence

At power-up, the PD pin is recommended to be kept low until all three power supply rails (VBAT, PVDD, DVDD) are within the Recommended Operating Conditions.

When all power rails are applied and ready, releasing the PD pin powers up the internal digital circuitry. After releasing the PD pin a minimum 4ms wait time is recommended before releasing the STBY pin. Releasing the STBY pin powers up the internal analog circuitry. If this sequence is not possible and PD as well as STBY have to be released at the same time, the following state transition can take up to 6ms in which the device powers up the analog circuitry and maintains a proper internal boot procedure.

Any time a power fault happens after the analog circuitry is powered up (VBAT ready and STBY released), TAS6754-Q1 leaves PLAY or other states and go back to the Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) State, until the power fault disappears.
