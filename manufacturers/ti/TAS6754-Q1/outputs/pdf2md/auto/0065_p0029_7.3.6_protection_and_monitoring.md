## 7.3.6.1 Overcurrent Limit (Cycle-By-Cycle)

Under normal operation, during high level music playback, dynamic load currents can possibly rise beyond the maximum load current, ILIM, of the device. In these cases, the device dynamically limits the current into the load and operation continues without disruption and prevents undesired shutdown for transient music events.

## 7.3.6.2 Overcurrent Shutdown

If the output load current reaches ISD, such as during an output short to GND, then an Overcurrent Shutdown (OCSD) event occurs, limiting the peak current and shutting down the affected channel. The time to shutdown the channel varies depending on the severity of the short condition.

The channel is placed into the FAULT state with the output stage in Hi-Z.

Based on the configuration, a fault signal is generated, which by default generates an active low signal at the FAULT pin.

## 7.3.6.3 Current Sense

TAS6754-Q1 can measure the output current of each channel simultaneously. This functionality is completely integrated and requires no external components.

The channel output current measurement is performed at the rate of the sampling frequency Fs. The measured current amplitude is provided through SDOUT. For more details on the data transmission configuration see SDOUT. Note that the current measurement and the data transmission are two separate functions and both require proper setup before the data can be made available.

## 7.3.6.4 DC Detect

This circuit detects the DC offset continuously of the amplifier during normal operation. If the DC offset exceeds the DCFAULT threshold, that channel triggers a DC Fault Event and is placed in the FAULT state and the output stage is set to high impedance.

Based on the configuration, a fault signal is generated, which by default generates an active low signal at the FAULT Pin.

TI recommends to leave DC Detect enabled at all times to prevent speaker damage from excessive DC bias output.

### 7.3.5.3.4 Tweeter Detection

In most cases, using the TAS6754-Q1 built-in magnitude estimator and tweeter detection report is sufficient to perform the desired tweeter detection test. If a tweeter is properly connected in the system, the magnitude of the load impedance is close to the nominal impedance of the speaker, for example 4Ω.

### 7.3.5.4 Real-Time Load Diagnostics

Real-Time Load Diagnostics (RTLDG) allows the detection of shorted load (SL) and open load (OL) conditions during audio operation of the amplifier. To monitor the load impedance while in PLAY state the TAS6754-Q1 uses the devices integrated current sense to measure the output impedance by channel and compare the results with configurable thresholds. An internally generated pilot tone maintains the continuous detection of the output impedance, regardless if an external audio input signal is present.

### 7.3.5.5 DC Resistance Measurement

The TAS6754-Q1 supports a DC Resistance Measurement of the loads connected to each channel that can be read back to the system processor via I2C. To read out the DC resistance of the load connected to each channel, DC load diagnostics must be completed.
