# 7.3.5.1 DC Load Diagnostics

The DC load diagnostics are used to verify if the load is connected properly.

To support system level start up requirements of a fast time to audio:

- The diagnostics are available as soon as the device leaves the DEEP SLEEP mode and supplies are within the recommended operating range.
- The diagnostics do not rely on external audio input signals or clock and sync frequencies to be available.

DC Diagnostics complete successfully and allow a channel to enter MUTE or PLAY mode if the following tests pass on the output pins:

- No Short-to-Ground
- No Short-to-Power

## Context from Previous Sections

### 7.3.4.2 High-Frequency Pulse-Width Modulator (PWM)

The PWM modulator converts the input audio data into a switched signal of varying duty cycle. The PWM modulator is an advanced design with high bandwidth, low noise, low distortion, and excellent stability.

TAS6754-Q1 has configurable output PWM phase control to manage conducted and radiated emissions. This feature allows the channel output PWM phase offset to be changed relative to other channels.

### 7.3.4.3 Spread Spectrum Control

TAS6754-Q1 applies spread spectrum control to the modulator's clock signal. Controlling the spectrum of the clock signal translates into an optimized behavior of higher frequency signal components which are visible during EMI testing. Spread spectrum modulation is a PWM modulation technique that reduces the peaks seen in EMI measurements by varying the output PWM frequency, resulting in a wider spectrum but lower level.

### 7.3.4.4 Gate Drive

The gate driver accepts the low-voltage PWM signal and level shifts it to drive a high-current, full-bridge, power-FET stage.

The device uses proprietary techniques to optimize EMI and audio performance. The gate driver power supply voltage, GVDD, is internally generated and a decoupling capacitor must be connected.

The full H-bridge output stages use only NMOS transistors. Therefore, bootstrap capacitors are required for the proper operation of the high side NMOS transistors for the OUT-xP sides. A 1µF ceramic capacitor of quality X7R or better, rated appropriately for the applied voltages (including load dump voltages), must be connected from each output to the corresponding bootstrap input. The bootstrap capacitors connected between the BST pins and the corresponding output function as a floating power supply for the high-side N-channel power MOSFET gate drive circuitry. During each high-side switching cycle, the bootstrap capacitors hold the gate-to-source voltage high, keeping the high-side MOSFETs turned on.

The high-side FET gate driver of the OUT_xM side is supplied by a charge pump (CP) supply for all four channels. A 330nF ceramic capacitor of quality X7R or better, rated appropriately for the applied voltages (including load dump voltages), must be connected from the CP pin to PVDD. Additionally, a similarly rated 100nF ceramic capacitor must be connected from the CPC_TOP pin to the CPC_BOT pin.

### 7.3.4.5 Power FETs

The BTL output channel comprises four N-channel FETs for high efficiency and maximum power transfer to the load. These FETs are designed to handle the fast switching frequency and large voltage transients during operation within the Recommended Operating Conditions.

### 7.3.5 Load Diagnostics

The device incorporates both DC and AC load diagnostics which are used to determine the status of the load. The DC-diagnostics are turned on by default.
