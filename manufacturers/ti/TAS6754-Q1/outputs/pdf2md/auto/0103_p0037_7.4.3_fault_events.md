# 7.4.3 Fault Events

## 7.4.3.1 Power Fault Events

Power fault events are by default masked from pin reporting. This can be enabled. See FAULT for more details.

### 7.4.3.1.1 DVDD Power-On-Reset (POR)

When DVDD falls below VPOR_OFF, the device shuts down. All channels are set to SLEEP State, the DSP is disabled and I2C communication terminates. When DVDD rises above VPOR_SET or when the device is first powered and DVDD rises above VPOR_SET the device initiates a Power-On-Reset routine. During this routine all registers and device states are set to default values.

### 7.4.3.1.2 DVDD Undervoltage Fault

The DVDD undervoltage (UV) protection detects low voltages on the DVDD pin. In the event of a UV condition, the device moves all channels from PLAY/HI-Z to Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) state, disable the DSP, and update the I2C report registers.

### 7.4.3.1.3 VBAT Overvoltage Fault

When the VBAT supply rail rises above nominal range, a VBAT Overvoltage Fault event is created and the device enters into Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) State. Once VBAT falls back down into nominal range, the fault event is cleared.

## Context from Previous Section (7.4.2.1)

### 7.4.2.1.7 FAULT State

FAULT state is a device-internally generated mode that cannot be manually set by the user.

If one or more channels of the device are in PLAY state and encounter a fault, the device needs to take protective actions and shutdown one or more audio channels. The output FETs of only the affected channels are turned off and the output pins become high impedance. The reported state for affected channels is 'FAULT'.

**Possible reasons for individual channels to enter this state are:**

- Overcurrent Shutdown
- Load Current fault
- DC Diag fault
- Real-Time Load Diagnostic fault
- Channel over temperature shutdown, if configured to no auto-recovery

**Possible reason for all channels to enter this state is:**

- Global over temperature shutdown, if configured to no auto-recovery
- Charge Pump fault

### 7.4.2.1.8 Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) State

AUTOREC is a device-internally generated state that cannot be manually set by the user.

If one or more channels of the device are in PLAY state and encounter a fault, the device needs to take protective actions and shutdown one or more audio channels. The output FETs of the affected channels are turned off and the output pins become high impedance. Once the cause for the protective shutdown is no longer present, the device auto-recovers and resumes back to PLAY. The reported state for affected channels is 'AUTOREC'.

**Possible reason for individual channels to enter this state is:**

- Channel over temperature shutdown, OTSD(i), if configured to auto-recovery

**Possible reasons for all channels to enter this state are:**

- Power failures
- Clock Error
- Global over temperature shutdown, OTSD, if configured to auto-recovery
