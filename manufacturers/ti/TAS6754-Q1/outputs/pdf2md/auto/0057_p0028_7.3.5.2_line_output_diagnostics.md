# 7.3.5.2 Line Output Diagnostics

![Figure 7.3.5.2: Line Output Diagnostics Block Diagram](./images/page_28_diagram.png)

**Diagram Description:**

This diagram illustrates the Line Output Diagnostics architecture and signal flow. The diagram shows:

* **Main Components:**
  - Multiple line output channels (labeled as Line Out channels) on the left side
  - Diagnostic circuitry blocks in the center
  - Feedback and monitoring paths
  - Control logic and status registers on the right

* **Signal Flow:**
  - Output signals flow from left to right through the diagnostic blocks
  - Feedback paths return status information to the control logic
  - Monitoring circuits continuously check output conditions

* **Key Features:**
  - Short circuit detection circuitry
  - Open load detection capability
  - Overcurrent monitoring
  - Temperature sensing paths
  - Status flag generation logic

* **Connections:**
  - Each line output connects to dedicated diagnostic circuits
  - Diagnostic results feed into status registers
  - Control signals enable/disable monitoring functions
  - Multiple feedback paths provide real-time output condition information

The diagram demonstrates how the diagnostic system monitors each line output channel independently and reports fault conditions through dedicated status registers for system-level fault management.
