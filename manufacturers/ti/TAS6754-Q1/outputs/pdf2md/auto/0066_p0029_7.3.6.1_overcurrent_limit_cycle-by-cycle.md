# 7.3.6.1 Overcurrent Limit (Cycle-By-Cycle)

The overcurrent limit provides cycle-by-cycle protection against excessive current draw. This protection mechanism monitors the output current on a cycle-by-cycle basis and limits the current to a safe level by adjusting the duty cycle accordingly.

When the current exceeds the programmed threshold, the controller immediately terminates the current switching cycle and prevents the output current from rising further. This fast response ensures that the current does not reach levels that could damage the power components.

The overcurrent limit threshold can be programmed through configuration registers. The controller compares the sensed current signal against this threshold during each switching cycle. If the threshold is exceeded, the active switch is turned off for the remainder of that cycle, effectively limiting the peak current.

This protection operates independently of the slower thermal and average current protection mechanisms, providing an additional layer of safety for the power stage components.
