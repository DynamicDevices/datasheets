# 7.3.3.3 Analog Gain

Analog gain is applied to the signal before the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Increasing the analog gain amplifies the input signal, which can improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for weak signals. However, excessive analog gain may cause the signal to saturate or clip at the ADC input, resulting in distortion.

The analog gain is typically adjustable in discrete steps, and the available range and step size depend on the specific hardware implementation. Consult the device datasheet or register map for the exact gain values supported by your system.

## Configuration

Analog gain is usually controlled through a dedicated register or set of registers. The gain value may be specified directly in decibels (dB) or as an index that maps to a predefined gain table.

### Key Considerations

- **Dynamic Range:** Higher analog gain reduces the effective dynamic range of the ADC by bringing the noise floor closer to the signal level.
- **Saturation:** Monitor the signal level at the ADC input to avoid clipping when using high gain settings.
- **Noise Performance:** For very weak signals, analog gain is preferable to digital gain because it amplifies the signal before quantization noise is introduced.
- **Calibration:** Some systems require calibration to ensure accurate gain settings across temperature and process variations.

## Best Practices

- Start with moderate gain settings and adjust based on the observed signal strength and quality.
- Use automatic gain control (AGC) if available to dynamically adjust the gain based on input signal levels.
- Verify that the gain setting is appropriate for the expected input signal range to avoid saturation or excessive noise.
