# 7.3.3.2 High-Pass Filter

To protect speakers connected to the TAS6754-Q1, a DC blocking high pass filter is built into the audio processing path.

## Context from preceding section (7.3.3.1 PVDD Foldback)

PVDD Foldback applies a smooth compression to the audio signal to maintain a consistent dynamic range while the supply voltage (PVDD) varies. This feature helps to prevent unexpected output clipping and distortion in systems where the audio signal exceeds the supply headroom and can also be described as Automatic Gain Limiter (AGL).

**Figure 7-13: PVDD Foldback Example**

The diagram illustrates the PVDD Foldback behavior:
- The graph shows the relationship between PVDD voltage level and audio signal attenuation/gain over time
- Key phases are marked: "Attack Starts" (when PVDD drops and compression begins) and "Release Starts" (when PVDD recovers and gain is restored)
- The curve demonstrates smooth gain adjustment to maintain consistent dynamic range as supply voltage varies

## Earlier context (7.3.3 Digital Audio Processing)

TAS6754-Q1 offers advanced digital audio processing capabilities including:

- High-Pass Filter / DC Blocking
- Digital Volume Control
- PVDD Foldback / AGL
- Thermal Foldback
- Gain Compensation Biquads
- Real-Time Load Diagnostics
- Clip Detect
- Low Latency Path

The availability of specific features is dependent on the selected sampling frequency. Higher sampling frequencies reduce the available processing time of the integrated DSP and limit the amount of functions that can operate in parallel. Attention is needed to maintain that the total processing need of the enabled functions does not exceed the available amount of processing time at all sampling frequencies.
