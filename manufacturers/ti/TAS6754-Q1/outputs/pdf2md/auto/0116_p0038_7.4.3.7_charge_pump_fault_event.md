# 7.4.3.7 Charge Pump Fault Event

When a charge pump fault event occurs, the device will transition to the FAULT state. The charge pump fault is indicated by the CP_FAULT bit in the FAULT register. The charge pump fault can be cleared by writing a 1 to the CP_FAULT bit in the FAULT register.

The charge pump fault is triggered when the charge pump output voltage falls below the charge pump undervoltage threshold. This can occur if the charge pump is not able to generate sufficient voltage due to excessive load or malfunction.

When a charge pump fault is detected:

- The device transitions to FAULT state
- All outputs are disabled
- The nFAULT pin is asserted low (if enabled)
- The CP_FAULT bit in the FAULT register is set to 1

To recover from a charge pump fault:

1. Read the FAULT register to confirm the fault type
2. Address the root cause (check load conditions, verify charge pump operation)
3. Clear the fault by writing 1 to the CP_FAULT bit
4. Restart the device by transitioning through the appropriate state sequence
