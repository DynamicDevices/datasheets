# 7.4.3.1.2 DVDD Undervoltage Fault

The DVDD undervoltage fault occurs when the DVDD supply voltage falls below the DVDD undervoltage threshold. This fault is used to protect the device from operating outside of its specified voltage range.

When a DVDD undervoltage fault is detected:

- The fault is latched and the FAULT pin is asserted low
- The DVDD_UV bit in the FAULT register is set to 1
- The device enters a safe state and disables the outputs
- The fault condition must be cleared by the host before normal operation can resume

To clear the fault:

1. Remove the fault condition by ensuring DVDD is above the undervoltage threshold
2. Clear the fault bit by writing to the FAULT register
3. Re-enable the device outputs

The DVDD undervoltage threshold and hysteresis values are specified in the electrical characteristics section of the datasheet.
