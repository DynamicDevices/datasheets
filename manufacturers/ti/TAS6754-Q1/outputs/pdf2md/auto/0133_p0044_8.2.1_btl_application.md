**Figure 8-1: Typical 4 Channel BTL Application Schematic**

This schematic illustrates the typical application circuit for the TAS6754-Q1 configured in a 4-channel BTL (Bridge-Tied Load) configuration. Key elements include:

* **TAS6754-Q1 Device:** Central amplifier IC configured for 4-channel operation
* **Input Connections:** Audio input signal routing to the device
* **Power Supply:** Power supply connections and associated decoupling/filtering components
* **Output Stage:** BTL output configuration for driving 4 speaker channels
* **Supporting Components:** Passive components (capacitors, resistors, inductors) for proper device operation, filtering, and stability
* **Speaker Loads:** Four speaker outputs driven in BTL mode for optimal power delivery
