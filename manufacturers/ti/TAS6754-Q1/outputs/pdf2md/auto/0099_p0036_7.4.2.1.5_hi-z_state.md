# 7.4.2.1.5 Hi-Z State

The Hi-Z state is a high-impedance output state where the output driver is effectively disconnected from the pin. In this state, the pin neither sources nor sinks current, allowing external devices to drive the signal line without interference from the internal circuitry.

When configured in Hi-Z mode, the output buffer is disabled, and the pin can be used as an input or left floating. This state is particularly useful in multi-master bus systems, tri-state buses, or when multiple devices share a common signal line.

Key characteristics of the Hi-Z state include:

- Output driver is disabled (both high-side and low-side transistors are off)
- Pin presents high impedance to external circuitry
- No current is sourced or sunk by the pin
- External pull-up or pull-down resistors can be used to define a default logic level
- Pin can be safely driven by external sources without conflict

To enter Hi-Z state, the output enable control must be deasserted, typically through a register configuration or control signal. The specific implementation varies by device, but generally involves disabling the output stage of the I/O buffer.
