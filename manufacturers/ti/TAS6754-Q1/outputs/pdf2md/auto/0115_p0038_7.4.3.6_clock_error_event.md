# 7.4.3.6 Clock Error Event

A clock error event occurs when the clock source fails or becomes unreliable. This event is typically detected by the hardware monitoring circuitry and can trigger an interrupt or set a status flag.

When a clock error is detected, the system may take one or more of the following actions:

- Generate an interrupt to notify software of the clock failure
- Set a status bit in a control register to indicate the error condition
- Automatically switch to a backup or fail-safe clock source
- Enter a safe operating mode with reduced functionality

Software should implement appropriate error handling routines to respond to clock error events, which may include:

- Checking clock status registers to determine the nature of the failure
- Attempting to reinitialize the clock source
- Switching to an alternative clock configuration
- Logging the error for diagnostic purposes
- Taking system-level protective actions if necessary

The specific behavior and available recovery options depend on the hardware implementation and system requirements.
