# 7.3.7.5.1.1 External SYNC signal (GPIO sync)

The external SYNC signal allows synchronization of multiple devices to a common time base. When enabled, the device will synchronize its internal timing to rising edges detected on a designated GPIO pin.

## Configuration

To configure external GPIO sync:

- Select the GPIO pin to be used for the SYNC input
- Configure the pin direction as input
- Enable the SYNC function on the selected GPIO
- Configure the SYNC mode and polarity settings

## Operation

When external SYNC is enabled:

- The device monitors the selected GPIO pin for sync pulses
- On each rising edge (or configured polarity), the internal timing is adjusted
- The sync signal should be a periodic pulse train with stable frequency
- Multiple devices can be synchronized by connecting them to the same SYNC source

## Register Configuration

Configure the following registers to enable GPIO sync:

- Set the GPIO pin mux to select SYNC function
- Configure SYNC_CTRL register to enable external sync mode
- Set SYNC_POLARITY to define the active edge (rising/falling)
- Configure SYNC_THRESHOLD for input signal detection level

## Timing Considerations

- Ensure the SYNC signal meets minimum pulse width requirements
- Account for propagation delays between multiple synchronized devices
- The SYNC frequency should be compatible with the device's internal clock
- Jitter on the SYNC signal will affect synchronization accuracy
