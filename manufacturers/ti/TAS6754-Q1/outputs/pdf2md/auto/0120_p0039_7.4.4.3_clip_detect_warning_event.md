# 7.4.4.3 Clip Detect Warning Event

![Figure 7.4.4.3: Clip Detect Warning Event Diagram](./images/page_39_diagram.png)

**Diagram Description:**

This timing diagram illustrates the Clip Detect Warning Event mechanism. The diagram shows multiple signal traces over time:

* **Top trace (AUDIO_IN):** Shows the input audio signal waveform with amplitude variations. The signal exhibits clipping behavior where the waveform is truncated at maximum amplitude levels, indicated by flat-topped peaks.

* **Second trace (CLIP_DETECT):** A digital signal that pulses high when clipping is detected in the audio input. Multiple short pulses are shown corresponding to clipping events in the AUDIO_IN signal.

* **Third trace (CLIP_WARN):** The clip warning output signal. This trace shows a sustained high level that begins after a threshold number of clip detect events have occurred, indicating a persistent clipping condition.

* **Bottom trace (EVENT):** Shows the event generation timing. A pulse is generated when the clip warning condition is triggered.

The diagram demonstrates the temporal relationship between input signal clipping, clip detection pulses, the warning threshold being exceeded, and the resulting warning event generation. This illustrates how the system monitors for repeated clipping events and generates a warning when clipping persists beyond acceptable levels.
