# 7.4.2.1.7 FAULT State

The FAULT state is entered when a fault condition is detected during normal operation. The device remains in the FAULT state until the fault condition is cleared and the device is reset or power-cycled.

## Fault Detection

The following conditions will trigger entry into the FAULT state:

- Overvoltage condition on VOUT
- Undervoltage condition on VOUT
- Overcurrent condition
- Overtemperature condition
- Communication timeout (if enabled)
- Watchdog timer expiration (if enabled)

## Behavior in FAULT State

When the device enters the FAULT state:

- All power outputs are disabled
- The FAULT pin is asserted (pulled low)
- The fault status registers are updated to indicate the specific fault condition
- The device remains operational for I²C/SPI communication to allow fault interrogation
- Internal housekeeping functions continue to operate

## Fault Recovery

To recover from the FAULT state, the following steps must be taken:

1. Read the fault status registers to determine the cause of the fault
2. Remove or correct the fault condition
3. Clear the fault status registers via I²C/SPI command
4. Issue a software reset command, or cycle the device power

Once the fault is cleared and the device is reset, it will return to the INIT state and proceed through the normal startup sequence.

## Fault Status Registers

The fault condition can be interrogated by reading the appropriate status registers. The specific fault type is indicated by status bits that remain latched until explicitly cleared by the host controller.
