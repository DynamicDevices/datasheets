# 7.3.4.2 High-Frequency Pulse-Width Modulator (PWM)

The high-frequency PWM module provides a flexible mechanism for generating precision pulse-width modulated signals. This module is commonly used in power management applications, motor control, LED dimming, and other applications requiring accurate duty cycle control.

## Key Features

- Programmable frequency and duty cycle
- Multiple independent PWM channels
- Synchronization capabilities between channels
- Dead-time insertion for complementary outputs
- Hardware fault protection inputs
- Interrupt generation on period and duty cycle match

## Operation

The PWM operates by comparing a free-running counter against programmed threshold values. When the counter matches the period register, it resets to zero and begins counting again. When the counter matches the duty cycle register, the output toggles state. This comparison-based approach enables precise control over both frequency and duty cycle.

### Configuration

PWM configuration involves setting the following parameters:

- **Period Register**: Determines the PWM frequency
- **Duty Cycle Register**: Controls the pulse width and duty cycle
- **Prescaler**: Divides the input clock to achieve lower frequencies
- **Output Polarity**: Configures active-high or active-low output
- **Dead-Time**: Inserts programmable delay between complementary outputs

### Synchronization

Multiple PWM channels can be synchronized to ensure coordinated operation. The synchronization can be configured as:

- Master/slave configuration where one channel triggers others
- External synchronization input
- Software synchronization trigger

## Register Configuration

Configure the PWM module by programming the appropriate control and threshold registers. Ensure the module is disabled before changing critical parameters such as period or prescaler values to prevent glitches in the output waveform.
