# 7.4.1 Internal Reporting Signals

The following internal signals are available for reporting and monitoring purposes within the system. These signals provide critical status information and can be accessed through the appropriate register interfaces.

The internal reporting signals enable real-time visibility into system operation and facilitate debugging and performance analysis. Proper monitoring of these signals is essential for maintaining system integrity and identifying potential issues before they impact performance.

Key characteristics of internal reporting signals include:

- Real-time status updates
- Register-based access for software monitoring
- Integration with diagnostic and debug subsystems
- Low-latency reporting for time-critical applications

System designers should incorporate appropriate monitoring of these signals into their software stack to enable comprehensive system health monitoring and rapid fault identification.
