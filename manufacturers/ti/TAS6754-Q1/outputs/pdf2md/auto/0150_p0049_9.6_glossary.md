# 9.6 Glossary

**AHB** – Advanced High-performance Bus. A bus protocol that is part of the AMBA (Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture) specification.

**API** – Application Programming Interface. A set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of applications that access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.

**APB** – Advanced Peripheral Bus. A simpler bus protocol that is part of the AMBA specification, typically used for lower bandwidth peripheral connections.

**AMBA** – Advanced Microcontroller Bus Architecture. An open standard, on-chip interconnect specification for the connection and management of functional blocks in system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs.

**BSP** – Board Support Package. A collection of low-level software and drivers specific to a particular hardware platform.

**CPU** – Central Processing Unit. The primary component of a computer that performs most of the processing.

**DMA** – Direct Memory Access. A feature that allows certain hardware subsystems to access main system memory independently of the CPU.

**FIFO** – First In, First Out. A method for organizing and manipulating a data buffer where the oldest (first) entry is processed first.

**GPIO** – General Purpose Input/Output. Programmable pins on an integrated circuit that can be configured as either inputs or outputs.

**HAL** – Hardware Abstraction Layer. Software that provides a uniform interface to underlying hardware, hiding hardware-specific details from higher-level code.

**I2C** – Inter-Integrated Circuit. A multi-master, multi-slave, packet switched, single-ended, serial communication bus.

**IDE** – Integrated Development Environment. A software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development.

**ISR** – Interrupt Service Routine. A function that is called when an interrupt occurs.

**JTAG** – Joint Test Action Group. An industry standard for verifying designs and testing printed circuit boards after manufacture.

**MCU** – Microcontroller Unit. A small computer on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals.

**NVIC** – Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller. An interrupt controller that is part of the ARM Cortex-M processor architecture.

**OS** – Operating System. System software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.

**PWM** – Pulse Width Modulation. A technique for getting analog results with digital means by rapidly switching a digital signal between on and off states.

**RAM** – Random Access Memory. A form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code.

**ROM** – Read-Only Memory. A type of non-volatile memory used in computers and other electronic devices.

**RTC** – Real-Time Clock. A computer clock that keeps track of the current time.

**SDK** – Software Development Kit. A collection of software development tools in one installable package.

**SPI** – Serial Peripheral Interface. A synchronous serial communication interface specification used for short-distance communication.

**SRAM** – Static Random-Access Memory. A type of semiconductor memory that uses bistable latching circuitry to store each bit.

**UART** – Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter. A hardware device for asynchronous serial communication.

**USB** – Universal Serial Bus. An industry standard that establishes specifications for cables, connectors and protocols for connection, communication and power supply between computers and devices.

**WDT** – Watchdog Timer. An electronic timer that is used to detect and recover from computer malfunctions.
