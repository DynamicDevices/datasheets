# 7.3.6.8 Power Failures

Power failures can occur at any time during the operation of the system. The system should be designed to handle power failures gracefully, ensuring that data is not lost and that the system can recover properly when power is restored.

When a power failure occurs, the following sequence of events typically takes place:

- The power supply voltage drops below the minimum operating threshold
- The processor detects the power failure condition through voltage monitoring circuits
- Critical system state is saved to non-volatile memory if time permits
- The system enters a safe shutdown state
- When power is restored, the system performs a power-on reset sequence
- Saved state information is retrieved from non-volatile memory
- Normal operation resumes

To handle power failures effectively, systems should implement:

- **Voltage monitoring circuits** to detect when the supply voltage falls below acceptable levels
- **Power-fail interrupt capability** to allow the processor to save critical data before shutdown
- **Non-volatile memory** (battery-backed RAM, EEPROM, or flash) to preserve important system state
- **Adequate hold-up time** in the power supply to allow orderly shutdown procedures to complete
- **Power-on reset circuits** to ensure proper initialization when power returns
- **Watchdog timers** to detect system lockup conditions that may occur during power restoration

The amount of time available between detecting a power failure and actual loss of processor operation depends on the energy storage capacity of the power supply (typically provided by bulk capacitors). This hold-up time must be sufficient to allow critical shutdown tasks to complete.

Systems that cannot tolerate any data loss should employ uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or battery backup systems to maintain operation during power outages.
