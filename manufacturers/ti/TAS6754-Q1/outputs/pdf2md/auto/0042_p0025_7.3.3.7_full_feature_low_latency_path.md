# 7.3.3.7 Full Feature Low Latency Path

![Figure 7.3.3.7: Full Feature Low Latency Path Block Diagram](./images/page_25_diagram.png)

**Diagram Description:**

This block diagram illustrates the Full Feature Low Latency Path architecture. The diagram shows the signal flow and processing stages:

* **Input Stage:** Audio input enters from the left side of the diagram
* **Processing Blocks:** The signal path flows through multiple processing stages arranged horizontally:
  - Initial input buffer/interface block
  - DSP processing core with multiple interconnected modules
  - Various processing stages shown as rectangular blocks with bidirectional connections
  - Control and configuration pathways indicated by connecting lines
* **Signal Flow:** 
  - Main audio signal path flows from left to right through the processing chain
  - Control signals and feedback paths are shown with additional connection lines
  - Multiple parallel processing paths are visible, suggesting concurrent operations
* **Output Stage:** Processed audio output exits on the right side
* **Key Features Illustrated:**
  - Low latency design with direct signal routing
  - Multiple processing stages maintaining signal integrity
  - Efficient data flow minimizing processing delays
  - Integration points for configuration and control

The diagram uses standard block diagram conventions with rectangular blocks representing functional units and lines representing signal or data flow paths between components.
