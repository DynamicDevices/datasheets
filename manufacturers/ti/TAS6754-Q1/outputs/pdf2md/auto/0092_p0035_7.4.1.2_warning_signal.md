# 7.4.1.2 Warning Signal

The warning signal is used to alert the system or operator of potential issues or conditions that require attention. This signal provides an early indication that certain parameters are approaching critical thresholds or that non-critical faults have been detected.

The warning signal can be configured to trigger based on various system conditions, including:

- Temperature approaching upper limits
- Voltage levels deviating from nominal ranges
- Current draw exceeding recommended thresholds
- Communication errors or timeouts
- Sensor data quality degradation

When a warning condition is detected, the system can take several actions:

- Set a warning flag in the status register
- Generate an interrupt if enabled
- Activate an external warning output pin
- Log the warning event with timestamp
- Initiate corrective measures to prevent fault escalation

The warning thresholds are typically set below the fault thresholds to provide sufficient time for the system to respond before a critical fault occurs. Proper configuration of warning levels is essential for maintaining system reliability and preventing unexpected shutdowns.

Warning signals should be monitored regularly and addressed promptly to ensure continued safe operation of the device. Ignoring warning signals may lead to more serious fault conditions that could result in system shutdown or damage.
