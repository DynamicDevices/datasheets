# 8.3.1.1 Electrical Connection of Thermal pad and Heat Sink

The thermal pad on the bottom of the package is used to remove heat from the device. For proper thermal performance, the thermal pad must be soldered to the PCB ground plane. The thermal pad should be connected to the PCB ground plane using multiple vias to provide a low thermal resistance path to the heat sink or PCB copper planes.

The heat sink, if used, must be electrically connected to ground potential. If the heat sink is not at ground potential, it must be electrically isolated from the thermal pad using a thermal interface material with appropriate electrical isolation properties.

## Thermal Pad Connection Guidelines

- Connect the thermal pad to the largest ground plane possible
- Use multiple thermal vias (recommended: 0.3mm diameter, 0.5mm pitch) under the thermal pad
- Ensure good solder coverage on the thermal pad to minimize thermal resistance
- The ground plane should be at least as large as the thermal pad area
- For optimal thermal performance, extend the ground plane beyond the thermal pad area

## Heat Sink Mounting

If an external heat sink is used:

- Ensure proper mechanical attachment to the PCB
- Use thermal interface material (TIM) between the package and heat sink
- Verify the heat sink is electrically connected to ground or properly isolated
- Consider airflow direction and PCB orientation for natural or forced convection cooling

## Electrical Isolation Considerations

When electrical isolation between the thermal pad and heat sink is required:

- Use an electrically isolating thermal interface material
- Verify the isolation material meets the required voltage withstand specification
- Account for the additional thermal resistance introduced by the isolation material
- Perform thermal testing to validate the thermal solution under worst-case conditions
