# 7.3.6.7.1 Overtemperature Shutdown

The temperature thresholds for global OTSD and for overtemperature shutdowns generated by the output channels, OTSD(i) are set to fixed values. Refer to Section 5.5 for the nominal temperature and recovery hysteresis values.

**Global OTSD**: If the global junction temperature rises above the OTSD threshold, all channels are placed into a protective shutdown state and an Overtemperature Shutdown (OTSD) Event is created.

**Channel-specific OTSD**: If the junction temperature of a channel rises above the OTSD threshold, the affected channel is put into a protective state and an Overtemperature Shutdown (OTSD) Event is created.

The tolerance of the warning levels and OTSD temperatures track each other.

By default, a fault signal generates an active low signal on the FAULT Pin when an OTSD event occurs.

### 7.3.6.5 Digital Clip Detect

The DSP monitors the audio signal of each channel individually and compares the magnitude of the audio signal at the input to the interpolation filters to a configurable threshold. If the audio signal exceeds the threshold, a Clip Detect Warning Event is triggered.

TAS6754-Q1 supports Pseudo-Analog Clip Detect (PACD). With PACD the DSP processing mimics an analog Clip Detect approach by taking the analog gain and supply voltage into account when determining if the output is clipping against a set clipping threshold.

### 7.3.6.6 Charge Pump

The TAS6754-Q1 has built-in protections on the charge pump pins (CP, CPC_TOP, and CPC_BOT). When the device detects a fault condition on the charge pins the charge pump skips a clock cycle. This is considered one fault cycle. The device tries again on the next incoming clock cycle. If a fault condition is detected two times consecutively or three times in total, the charge pump starts to ignore the incoming clock and go into a Charge Pump Fault condition with the output stage in Hi-Z and charge pump shutdown.

Based on the configuration, a fault signal is generated, which by default generates an active low signal at the FAULT pin.

### 7.3.6.7 Temperature Protection and Monitoring

The device monitors temperature with five temperature sensors. Every output channel has a temperature sensor in close proximity to the center of the output channels output stage to monitor the temperature of each channel separately. An additional temperature sensor is located in a global position on the die, this better represents the actual die junction temperature. Based on these sensors, warning and fault signals can be generated. A Thermal Gain Foldback scheme is available that autonomously regulates audio gain and consequently limits die temperature.

**Figure 7-17. Abstract Temperature Sensor Locations Within the Device**

This diagram shows the physical layout of the five temperature sensors within the TAS6754-Q1 device:

- **Four Channel-Specific Temperature Sensors (OT1, OT2, OT3, OT4)**: Each of the four output channels (CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4) has a dedicated temperature sensor positioned in close proximity to the FETs (field-effect transistors) of the respective channel's output stage. These sensors monitor the localized temperature of each channel independently.
  - OT1 is located near CH1 FETs
  - OT2 is located near CH2 FETs
  - OT3 is located near CH3 FETs
  - OT4 is located near CH4 FETs

- **One Global Temperature Sensor (OTGlobal)**: A fifth temperature sensor is centrally positioned on the die to provide a more accurate representation of the overall junction temperature. This global sensor is located between the channels and provides die-level thermal monitoring.

The diagram illustrates the strategic placement of these sensors to enable both per-channel thermal protection and overall device thermal management.
