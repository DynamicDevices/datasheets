# 7.5.1 I2C Serial Communication Bus

![Figure 7.5.1: I2C Serial Communication Bus Diagram](./images/page_39_diagram.png)

**Diagram Description:**

This figure illustrates the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) serial communication bus topology and configuration. The diagram shows:

* **Bus Structure:** A two-wire serial bus consisting of:
  - **SDA (Serial Data Line):** Bidirectional data line
  - **SCL (Serial Clock Line):** Clock signal line

* **Pull-up Resistors:** Both SDA and SCL lines are connected to VDD (positive supply voltage) through pull-up resistors (Rp), which maintain the lines in a high state when not actively driven low.

* **Master and Slave Devices:** The diagram depicts multiple devices connected to the same bus:
  - **Master Device:** Typically a microcontroller or processor that initiates communication and generates the clock signal on SCL
  - **Slave Devices:** Multiple peripheral devices (shown as separate blocks) that respond to the master's commands, each with a unique address

* **Multi-Master Capability:** The bus architecture supports multiple master devices, though only one master can control the bus at any given time. Arbitration mechanisms resolve conflicts when multiple masters attempt simultaneous access.

* **Connection Points:** Each device is connected in parallel to both the SDA and SCL lines, creating a shared bus topology where all devices can monitor communication.

* **Signal Characteristics:** The diagram emphasizes the open-drain/open-collector nature of the bus, where devices can only pull lines low (logic 0), and the pull-up resistors restore the high state (logic 1) when no device is actively driving the line.

This I2C bus configuration enables efficient communication between multiple integrated circuits using only two wires, making it popular for short-distance, intra-board communication in embedded systems.
