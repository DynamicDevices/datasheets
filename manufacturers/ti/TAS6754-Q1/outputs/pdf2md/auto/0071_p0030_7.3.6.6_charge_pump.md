# 7.3.6.6 Charge Pump

![Figure 7.3.6.6: Charge Pump Block Diagram](./images/page_30_diagram.png)

**Diagram Description:**

This diagram illustrates a charge pump circuit block diagram showing the following key components and connections:

* **Input Stage:**
  - VDD power supply input at the top
  - Clock input (CLK) signal feeding into the control logic

* **Main Components:**
  - **Control Logic Block:** Receives the clock signal and generates control signals for the switches
  - **Switch Network:** Four switches (S1, S2, S3, S4) arranged to control the charge transfer between capacitors
  - **Flying Capacitor (CFLY):** The main charge transfer capacitor positioned in the center of the circuit
  - **Output Capacitor (COUT):** Connected to the output stage for voltage smoothing

* **Signal Flow:**
  - Clock Phase 1: S1 and S3 close, charging CFLY from VDD
  - Clock Phase 2: S2 and S4 close, transferring charge from CFLY to COUT
  - The switching action alternates to pump charge from input to output

* **Output Stage:**
  - VOUT output terminal providing the stepped voltage
  - Ground (GND) connection at the bottom

The circuit demonstrates a typical voltage multiplier/charge pump topology used to generate higher output voltages from a lower supply voltage through capacitive charge transfer.
