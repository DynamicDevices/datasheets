# 7.3.5.1.4 Short-to-Ground

A short-to-ground fault occurs when an output channel is shorted to ground (GND). This condition can be detected by monitoring the output voltage and current.

## Detection Method

The device monitors the output voltage and compares it to expected thresholds. When an output is shorted to ground:

- The output voltage drops significantly below the expected level
- The current limiting circuitry activates to protect the device
- A diagnostic flag is set in the status register

## Diagnostic Response

When a short-to-ground condition is detected:

- The affected channel may be disabled depending on configuration
- The SPI diagnostic registers are updated to reflect the fault condition
- An interrupt can be generated if enabled
- The device continues to monitor for fault clearance

## Recovery

The system can recover from a short-to-ground fault through:

- **Automatic retry**: The device can be configured to automatically attempt to re-enable the output after a programmed delay
- **Manual reset**: The application software can clear the fault flag and re-enable the output via SPI command
- **Power cycle**: A complete device reset will clear all fault conditions

## Register Configuration

Relevant registers for short-to-ground detection and handling include diagnostic enable registers, fault status registers, and retry configuration registers. Refer to the register map section for specific bit definitions and addresses.
