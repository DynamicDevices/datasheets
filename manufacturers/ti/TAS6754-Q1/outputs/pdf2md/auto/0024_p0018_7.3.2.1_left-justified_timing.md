**Detailed Description of Left-Justified Timing Diagram:**

This timing diagram illustrates the left-justified timing mode for digital audio interface signals. The diagram shows the relationship between multiple signals over time:

* **LRCLK (Left-Right Clock)**: A square wave signal that toggles between logic high and low states to indicate left and right audio channels. The signal transitions define the channel boundaries.

* **BCLK (Bit Clock)**: A higher frequency clock signal that provides timing for individual bit transmissions. Multiple BCLK cycles occur during each LRCLK period.

* **DATA (Serial Data)**: The audio data stream shown with bit positions labeled as MSB (Most Significant Bit) through LSB (Least Significant Bit). The data is left-justified, meaning the MSB is transmitted immediately following the LRCLK transition, with no delay.

**Key Timing Characteristics:**

* The MSB of the audio data is aligned (justified) to the left - it appears immediately after the LRCLK transition
* Data bits are clocked out sequentially from MSB to LSB on successive BCLK edges
* The LRCLK transition occurs simultaneously with or just before the first data bit (MSB)
* After the LSB is transmitted, the data line may remain in a defined state until the next LRCLK transition and subsequent channel data

This left-justified format is commonly used in I²S-compatible audio interfaces where early data alignment is required for processing or compatibility with certain receiver implementations.
