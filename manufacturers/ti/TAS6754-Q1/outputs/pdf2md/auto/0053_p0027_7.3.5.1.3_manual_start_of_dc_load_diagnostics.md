# 7.3.5.1.3 Manual start of DC load diagnostics

The DC load diagnostics can be started manually to check the load status independent of the automatic diagnostics cycle. This is useful for debugging or verification purposes during development and commissioning.

To manually trigger the DC load diagnostics, the application software must set the appropriate control bit in the diagnostic control register. The diagnostics will then execute once and report the results in the diagnostic status register.

## Procedure

1. Ensure the DC load is in a safe state for diagnostics (e.g., not actively supplying critical loads)
2. Set the manual diagnostic start bit in the control register
3. Wait for the diagnostic completion flag in the status register
4. Read the diagnostic results from the status register
5. Clear the manual diagnostic start bit

## Register Details

The following registers are used to control and monitor the manual DC load diagnostics:

- **Diagnostic Control Register**: Contains the manual start trigger bit
- **Diagnostic Status Register**: Reports completion status and diagnostic results

## Timing Considerations

The manual diagnostic cycle typically completes within 100-500 milliseconds, depending on the number of load channels being tested. The application should implement a timeout mechanism to detect if the diagnostics fail to complete within the expected timeframe.

## Safety Notes

- Do not start manual diagnostics while the load is actively switched on
- Ensure adequate time between consecutive diagnostic cycles to allow the hardware to stabilize
- Always verify the completion flag before reading diagnostic results
