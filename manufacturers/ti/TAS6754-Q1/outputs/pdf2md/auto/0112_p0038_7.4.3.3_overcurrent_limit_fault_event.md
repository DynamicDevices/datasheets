# 7.4.3.3 Overcurrent Limit Fault Event

The overcurrent limit fault event occurs when the motor current exceeds the programmed overcurrent limit threshold. This fault is designed to protect the motor and drive electronics from damage due to excessive current flow.

## Fault Detection

The drive continuously monitors the motor current and compares it against the configured overcurrent limit threshold. When the measured current exceeds this threshold for a duration longer than the programmed time delay, the overcurrent limit fault is triggered.

### Key Parameters

- **Overcurrent Threshold**: Programmable limit that defines the maximum allowable motor current
- **Time Delay**: Configurable delay period before the fault is triggered after threshold is exceeded
- **Response Action**: Configurable response when fault occurs (e.g., coast stop, ramp stop, or controlled stop)

## Fault Response

When an overcurrent limit fault is detected:

- The drive executes the programmed fault response action
- The fault status is recorded in the fault history log
- Appropriate fault codes and diagnostic information are stored
- The drive status indicates the active fault condition

## Recovery and Reset

To recover from an overcurrent limit fault:

1. Identify and correct the root cause of the overcurrent condition
2. Clear the fault condition through the control interface or by cycling power
3. Verify that motor current is within acceptable limits before restarting
4. Review fault history and diagnostic data to prevent recurrence

## Common Causes

- Motor overload or mechanical binding
- Incorrect motor parameters or tuning
- Supply voltage fluctuations
- Short circuit conditions
- Aggressive acceleration/deceleration profiles
- Improper overcurrent threshold settings
