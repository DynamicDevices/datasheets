# 7.4.2.1.6 PLAY State

In PLAY state the device is fully operational. The output stages are active, switching and amplify the input signal.

Real-Time Load Diagnostics can be activated to monitor the connected load for shorts or open conditions.

## 7.4.2.1.1 SHUTDOWN State

The device remains in shutdown when the PD pin is pulled low. All internal regulators are disabled for minimal power consumption.

Releasing the PD pin starts the device and resets all registers to the default value. SHUTDOWN is maintained on a device level with no deviation for individual channels.

## 7.4.2.1.2 DEEP SLEEP State

DEEP SLEEP puts the device in a standby state. In DEEP SLEEP, the I2C communication and registers as well as the 1.5V LDO for the digital core are active. All other regulators remain deactivated to save energy.

DEEP SLEEP is an appropriate state to configure the device through I2C before powering up. Unlike SHUTDOWN state, entering or exiting DEEP SLEEP state maintains the register map and DSP memory.

**Note**  
The DSP is deactivated in DEEP SLEEP.

## 7.4.2.1.3 LOAD DIAG State

Diagnostic mode engages the DC Diagnostic circuitry to test for Short to Power, Short to Ground, Shorted Load and Open Load without activating the output power stage. These tests must be completed without fault before the Output FETs can be activated. For a more detailed description see DC Load Diagnostics.

The DC diagnostics are available as soon as the device supplies are within the Recommended Operating Conditions. The DC diagnostics do not rely on external audio input signals or clock and sync frequencies to be available.

LOAD DIAG can be set on a channel level. Channels transition to SLEEP state mode after successfully passing the diagnostic tests.

## 7.4.2.1.4 SLEEP State

SLEEP state activates further functional blocks in comparison to the DEEP SLEEP state, including the internal LDO for analog circuitry and gate driver. The supply for the Digital-to-PWM conversion remains deactivated.

SLEEP can be set on a channel level. Each channel transitions to Hi-Z state by setting the State Control register to either Hi-Z or PLAY under the condition that no clock error is present.

## 7.4.2.1.5 Hi-Z State

In Hi-Z state the output driver is set to a high impedance state while all other blocks are fully functional.

The channel transitions to PLAY state by setting the State Control register to PLAY.
