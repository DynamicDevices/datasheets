# 7.4.2.1.1 SHUTDOWN State

In the SHUTDOWN state, the device is in its lowest power consumption mode. The following conditions apply:

- All internal circuits are powered down except for the power-on reset (POR) circuit
- The device does not respond to any input signals or communication attempts
- All outputs are in a high-impedance state
- Current consumption is at its minimum level

## Entering SHUTDOWN State

The device enters the SHUTDOWN state under the following conditions:

- Power-on reset (POR) is active (VDD below the POR threshold)
- The SHUTDOWN command has been issued via the communication interface
- A critical fault condition has been detected that requires complete shutdown

## Exiting SHUTDOWN State

To exit the SHUTDOWN state, one of the following conditions must occur:

- VDD rises above the POR threshold and stabilizes
- A hardware reset signal is applied
- The device receives a wake-up command (if supported by the specific implementation)

## Power Consumption

In SHUTDOWN state, the device consumes minimal current, typically in the range of microamperes or lower, depending on the specific device variant and operating conditions.
