# 7.3.2.5 SDOUT - Data Output

![Figure 7.3.2.5: SDOUT - Data Output](./images/page_22_diagram.png)

## Description

The SDOUT pin is the serial data output from the device. This pin outputs data in a serial format synchronized with the serial clock.

### Key Characteristics

* **Pin Function:** Serial Data Output
* **Data Direction:** Output from device
* **Synchronization:** Data is clocked out on SDOUT synchronized with the serial clock (SCLK)
* **Data Format:** Serial bitstream
* **Timing:** Data transitions occur relative to the clock edges as specified in the timing diagrams

### Operation

The SDOUT pin transmits data from the device's internal registers or conversion results to the external controller. Data is shifted out serially, with timing determined by the serial clock signal. The controller reads this data to retrieve configuration status, conversion results, or other device information.

### Related Signals

* **SCLK:** Serial clock that controls the timing of data output
* **CS/SS:** Chip select signal that enables serial communication
* **SDIN:** Serial data input (for bidirectional communication protocols)
