# 7.4.2.1.8 Auto Recovery (AUTOREC) State

The AUTOREC state is entered when the device detects a fault condition that can be automatically recovered. In this state, the device attempts to clear the fault and return to normal operation without user intervention.

## Entry Conditions

The device enters the AUTOREC state when:

- A recoverable fault is detected during normal operation
- The fault counter has not exceeded the maximum retry limit
- Auto-recovery is enabled in the configuration registers

## State Behavior

During the AUTOREC state, the device performs the following actions:

- Disables all outputs to prevent damage or unsafe operation
- Attempts to clear the fault condition by resetting the affected circuitry
- Increments the fault recovery counter
- Monitors the fault status for a predetermined recovery time

## Exit Conditions

The device exits the AUTOREC state when:

- The fault condition is successfully cleared and normal operation can resume (transitions to ACTIVE state)
- The maximum number of recovery attempts is reached (transitions to FAULT state)
- A critical fault is detected that cannot be auto-recovered (transitions to FAULT state)
- The device receives a reset command (transitions to INIT state)

## Recovery Counter

The device maintains an internal recovery counter that tracks the number of consecutive auto-recovery attempts. This counter:

- Increments each time the AUTOREC state is entered
- Resets to zero after a successful recovery and a period of stable operation
- Triggers a transition to FAULT state when the maximum count is exceeded

The maximum recovery attempt limit is configurable through the device configuration registers and helps prevent infinite recovery loops in case of persistent fault conditions.
