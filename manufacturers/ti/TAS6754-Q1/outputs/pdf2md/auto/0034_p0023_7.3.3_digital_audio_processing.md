# 7.3.3 Digital Audio Processing

TAS6754-Q1 offers advanced digital audio processing capabilities including:

- High-Pass Filter / DC Blocking
- Digital Volume Control
- PVDD Foldback / AGL
- Thermal Foldback
- Gain Compensation Biquads
- Real-Time Load Diagnostics
- Clip Detect
- Low Latency Path

The availability of specific features is dependent on the selected sampling frequency. Higher sampling frequencies reduce the available processing time of the integrated DSP and limit the amount of functions that can operate in parallel. Attention is needed to maintain that the total processing need of the enabled functions does not exceed the available amount of processing time at all sampling frequencies.

## 7.3.3.1 PVDD Foldback

PVDD Foldback applies a smooth compression to the audio signal to maintain a consistent dynamic range while the supply voltage (PVDD) varies. This feature helps to prevent unexpected output clipping and distortion in systems where the audio signal exceeds the supply headroom and can also be described as Automatic Gain Limiter (AGL).

**Figure 7-13: PVDD Foldback Example**

The diagram illustrates the PVDD Foldback mechanism showing:
- The PVDD supply voltage level over time
- The MPOV (Minimum Power-on Voltage) threshold
- Attack phase: where compression starts when PVDD drops below threshold
- Release phase: where the system returns to normal operation when PVDD recovers
- The smooth transition between compressed and normal states to prevent clipping

## 7.3.3.2 High-Pass Filter

To protect speakers connected to the TAS6754-Q1, a DC blocking high pass filter is built into the audio processing path.

### 7.3.2.6.3 Sample Rate on the Fly Change

TAS6754-Q1 supports an on-the-fly change of the FSYNC rate. When changing FSYNC, for example from 48kHz to 96kHz, the host processor needs to put the FSYNC/SCLK to halt state for at least 30ms before changing to the new sample rate. During this halt state a clock error is reported. See Clock Halt Auto-recovery section for further details.

### 7.3.2.7 Clock Error Handling

After Power-On-Reset (POR) the device assumes that a clock error exists, but does not assert the clock error flag until the clock error detection result is valid.

If any input clock changes are detected, the auto detect system immediately requests the device to mute gracefully by holding the last received sample from the audio interface, while the auto detect continues to monitor and identify a new stable condition.
