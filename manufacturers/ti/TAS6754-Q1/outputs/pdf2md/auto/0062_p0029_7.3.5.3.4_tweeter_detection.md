# 7.3.5.3.4 Tweeter Detection

Tweeter detection is a mechanism to identify high-frequency content in the audio signal and route it appropriately through the signal processing chain. This feature enables the system to optimize processing for tweeter speakers, which are designed to reproduce high-frequency sounds.

The tweeter detection algorithm analyzes the incoming audio signal and determines whether the content contains predominantly high-frequency components. When high-frequency content is detected, the system can apply specific processing or routing to ensure optimal reproduction through tweeter speakers.

## Configuration and Control

The tweeter detection feature is controlled through dedicated registers that allow configuration of detection thresholds, time constants, and routing options. These parameters enable fine-tuning of the detection algorithm to match the specific characteristics of the tweeter speakers and the desired system behavior.

## Key Parameters

- **Detection Threshold**: Sets the frequency threshold above which content is considered tweeter-appropriate
- **Time Constants**: Control the attack and release times for the detection algorithm to prevent rapid switching
- **Routing Options**: Determine how detected tweeter content is processed and directed through the audio chain

## Operation

When enabled, the tweeter detection block continuously monitors the spectral content of the audio signal. Upon detecting sustained high-frequency content that exceeds the configured threshold, the system activates the tweeter processing path. The time constants ensure smooth transitions to avoid audible artifacts during content changes.
