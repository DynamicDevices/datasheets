# 7.3.6.2 Overcurrent Shutdown

The device includes overcurrent protection to prevent damage during fault conditions. When the output current exceeds the overcurrent threshold, the device will initiate a shutdown sequence.

The overcurrent shutdown threshold is typically set between 150% and 200% of the maximum rated output current. Once triggered, the device will:

- Disable the output stage immediately
- Set the fault status register
- Assert the fault pin (if available)
- Enter a protection mode

Recovery from an overcurrent shutdown condition requires clearing the fault condition and cycling the enable pin or power cycling the device, depending on the configuration settings.

The overcurrent detection circuit monitors the output current continuously. If the current exceeds the threshold for longer than the overcurrent timeout period (typically 10-50 microseconds), the shutdown sequence is initiated.

Overcurrent protection can be configured through the appropriate control registers. Consult the register map section for specific register addresses and bit definitions related to overcurrent protection settings.
