# 7.4.2.1.4 SLEEP State

In the SLEEP state, the device enters a low-power mode to conserve energy. The device can be configured to wake up from SLEEP state through various wake-up sources.

During SLEEP state:

- The CPU clock is stopped
- Peripheral clocks may be stopped or continue running depending on configuration
- RAM contents are retained
- I/O pin states are maintained
- Wake-up sources remain active and can trigger an exit from SLEEP

The device exits SLEEP state when any enabled wake-up event occurs, returning to normal operation mode.
