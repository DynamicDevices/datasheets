4 Device and Documentation Support
TI offers an extensive line of development tools. Tools and software to evaluate the performance of the device,
generate code, and develop solutions are listed below.
4.1 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates
To receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com. Click on
Notifications to register and receive a weekly digest of any product information that has changed. For change
details, review the revision history included in any revised document.
4.2 Support Resources
TI E2E™ support forums are an engineer's go-to source for fast, verified answers and design help — straight
from the experts. Search existing answers or ask your own question to get the quick design help you need.
Linked content is provided "AS IS" by the respective contributors. They do not constitute TI specifications and do
not necessarily reflect TI's views; see TI's Terms of Use.
4.3 Trademarks
TI E2E™ is a trademark of Texas Instruments.
All trademarks are the property of their respective owners.
4.4 Electrostatic Discharge Caution
                  This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD. Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled
                  with appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.
                  ESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may
                  be more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published
                  specifications.
