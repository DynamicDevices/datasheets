![ESD Warning Symbol](./images/page_2_img_inline_1.png)

**ESD Caution Symbol:** The image shows the standard triangular ESD warning symbol with a hand reaching toward a circuit, crossed out to indicate caution must be taken when handling the device.

This integrated circuit can be damaged by ESD. Texas Instruments recommends that all integrated circuits be handled with appropriate precautions. Failure to observe proper handling and installation procedures can cause damage.

ESD damage can range from subtle performance degradation to complete device failure. Precision integrated circuits may be more susceptible to damage because very small parametric changes could cause the device not to meet its published specifications.
