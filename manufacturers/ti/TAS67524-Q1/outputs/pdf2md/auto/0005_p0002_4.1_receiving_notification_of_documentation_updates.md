**Figure 4-1: Documentation Update Notification Process**

This diagram illustrates the workflow for receiving and processing documentation update notifications. The process includes the following key components and flow:

* **Notification Sources**: Updates originate from multiple channels including email notifications, RSS feeds, and direct system alerts
* **Central Notification Hub**: All incoming notifications are aggregated and processed through a central hub
* **User Interface**: Notifications are displayed to users through a dashboard or notification panel
* **Action Options**: Users can take several actions upon receiving notifications:
  * Review the updated documentation immediately
  * Mark for later review
  * Subscribe to specific document categories
  * Configure notification preferences
* **Tracking and History**: The system maintains a log of all notifications and user responses for audit and tracking purposes

The flow demonstrates a cyclical process where user preferences and actions feed back into the notification system to improve relevance and delivery of future updates.
