# 6.2.3  Stream

The stream benchmark is a simple synthetic benchmark program that measures the sustainable memory bandwidth (in MB/s) and the corresponding computation rate for simple vector kernels.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. All phases, such as Copy, Scale, Add, and Triad, are included.
4. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the stream, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
2. Run `setup.sh`, see Section 8.
3. Run `streamcpy_loop.sh`:

```bash
while [ "1" == "1" ]; do
  taskset -c 0 stream -M 200M -N 1000 & 
  taskset -c 1 stream -M 200M -N 1000
done
```

4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 12 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
