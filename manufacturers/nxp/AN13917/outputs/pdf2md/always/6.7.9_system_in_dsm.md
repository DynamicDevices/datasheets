# 6.7.9 System in DSM

The use case is based on the Suspend mode, which implies the following:

- CA55 cluster is OFF
- MEDIAMIX is OFF
- NICMIX is OFF
- WAKEUPMIX is ON
- PLL is OFF
- 24 M OSC is OFF
- PMIC is in STBY mode

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The DDR is in the Retention mode.
2. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the system in the DSM, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk-DSM.dtb`.
2. To put the system into the Suspend (Deep sleep) mode, run the following command:

```bash
echo mem > /sys/power/state
```

3. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 32 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
