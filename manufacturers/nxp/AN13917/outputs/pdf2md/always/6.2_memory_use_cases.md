# 6.2  Memory use cases

The following memory-centric use case scenarios have been tested:

- memset
- memcpy
- Stream

The memset and memcpy are part of a perf-bench, which is a general framework for benchmark suites.

## 6.2.1  memset

The memset use case is for evaluating the performance of a simple memory set in various ways.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The size for the memory buffers is set to 1024 MB.
4. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the memset, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
2. Run `setup.sh`, see Section 8.
3. Run `memset_loop.sh`:

```bash
while true; do
  buff_size=`cat /proc/meminfo | grep CmaFree | awk '{print$2}'`
  perf bench -f simple mem memset -l 20000 -s ${buff_size}KB
done
```

4. Measure the power and record the results.
