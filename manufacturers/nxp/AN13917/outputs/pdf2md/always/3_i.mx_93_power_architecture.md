# 3 i.MX 93 power architecture

The power architecture of the chip is established with the presumption that the most affordable systems are built for the scenario in which the PMIC is used to supply all the power rails to the processor.

Figure 1 shows the power architecture diagram for the entire SoC.

**Note:** Figure 1 shows only the power supplies and does not show the capacitors that can be required for internal LDO regulators.

The values in Figure 1 are for reference purpose only. For actual values, refer i.MX 93 EVK Applications Processors Data Sheet.

From an architectural standpoint, most SoC digital and analog logic can be power gated in Low-power mode through an external PMIC supply or an internal power switch.
