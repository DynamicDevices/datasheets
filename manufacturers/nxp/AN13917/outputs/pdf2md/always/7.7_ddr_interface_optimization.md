# 7.7 DDR interface optimization

To optimize the DDR interface, the suggestions are as follows:

• Employ careful board routing of the DDR memories, maintaining the PCB trace lengths as short as possible. Longer trace lengths and more vias create more PCB capacitance for the signal, resulting in more energy wastage along the signal path.

• Keep the on-die termination (ODT) value as low as possible. The termination used greatly influences the power consumption of the DDR interface pins. To ensure the ODT variance does not reduce the bus signal integrity, simulate the DDR interface.

• Use an appropriate output driver impedance for the DDR interface pins that provide good impedance matching. Select the lowest possible drive strength that provides the required performance to reduce the current flowing through the DDR I/O pins. Remember that simulation must be done to ensure signal integrity.
