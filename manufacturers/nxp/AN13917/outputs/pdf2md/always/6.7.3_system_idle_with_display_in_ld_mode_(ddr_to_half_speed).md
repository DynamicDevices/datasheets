# 6.7.3  System Idle with display in LD mode (DDR to half speed)

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU default frequency is set to 0.9 GHz.
2. The DDR frequency is set to 1866 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption for the system Idle with display on LD mode with DDRC auto clock gating, DDR to half speed, the steps are as follows:

1. Connect the HDMI display to the board through the MIPI-to-HDMI converter card (IMX-MIPI-HDMI).
2. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk-ld.dtb`.
3. Run `setup_video.sh`.
4. To put the system into the LD mode (DDR to half speed), run the following command:

```bash
echo 2 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/mode
```

5. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 26 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
