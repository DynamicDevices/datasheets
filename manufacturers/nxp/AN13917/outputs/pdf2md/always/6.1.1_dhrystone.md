# 6.1.1  Dhrystone

Dhrystone is a synthetic benchmark used to measure the integer computational performance of processors and compilers. The small size of the Dhrystone benchmark enables it to fit into the L1 cache and minimizes access to the L2 cache and DDR.

In this use case, the two Cortex-A55 cores perform the Dhrystone test. Because Dhrystone is a single thread benchmark, two instances have been started. All Cortex-A55 cores run the test in a loop at a frequency of 1.7 GHz.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The display is OFF.
4. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of Dhrystone, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
2. Run `setup.sh`, see Section 8.
3. Run `dhrystone_loop.sh`:

```bash
while [ "1" == "1" ]; do
  taskset -c 0 ./dhry2 &
  taskset -c 1 ./dhry2
done
```

4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 8 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
