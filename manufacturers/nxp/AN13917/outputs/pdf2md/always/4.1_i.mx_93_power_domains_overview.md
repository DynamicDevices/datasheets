# 4.1  i.MX 93 power domains overview

To optimize the power consumption in Low-power modes, i.MX 93 has multiple power domains. As a result, most SoC digital and analog logics are power gated with an internal power switch or an external supply from PMIC in Low-power mode.

**Note:** The values in Table 3 are for reference purpose only. For actual values, refer i.MX 93 EVK Applications Processors Data Sheet.

## Table 3. SoC power domains

| Domain | Power supply | Type | Physical domains |
|--------|--------------|------|------------------|
| CPU | VDD_SOC | Digital | Cortex-A55 core |
| PDCPU0 | VDD_SOC with switch | Digital | Cortex-A55 core |
