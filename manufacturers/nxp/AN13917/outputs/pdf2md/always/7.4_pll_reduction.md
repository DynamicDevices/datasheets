# 7.4  PLL reduction

Each PLL block consumes significant energy when active. Each application has unique requirements, but, if possible, reduce the number of operating PLLs. The CCM within the i.MX 93 provides Root Clock mux and programmable control to each PLL either by direct control mode or CPU Low-power mode. As a result, the Root Clocks source is allowed to modify to limit the PLL source and reduce the number of active PLLs when operating. Ensure that the application considers the PLL relock time when transitioning back to full operation.
