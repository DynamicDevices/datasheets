# 6.7.7  System Idle without display in LD mode with DDRC auto clock gating (DDR to half speed)

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU default frequency is set to 0.9 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 1866 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption for the system Idle without display on LD mode with DDRC auto clock gating (DDR to half speed), the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk-ld.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh.
3. To put the system into the LD mode (DDR to half speed), run the following command:

```bash
echo 2 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/mode
```

4. To enable auto_clk_gating, run the following command:

```bash
echo 256 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/auto_clk_gating
```

Where 256 implies the duration for DDR Idle to enter self; the unit is the clock cycle.
