# 6.5  Machine learning use cases

The tested use case scenarios for machine learning are as follows:

- eIQ benchmark
- Machine vision

## 6.5.1  eIQ benchmark

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is running the NPU software driver.

To measure the power consumption of the eIQ benchmark, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh, see Section 8.
3. To generate the mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_vela.tflite model file under the path /usr/bin/tensorflow-lite-2.12.1/examples, run the following command:

```bash
vela mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant.tflite
```

4. Copy the mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_vela.tflite to /usr/bin/tensorflow-lite-2.12.1/examples from the output.
5. Copy ML_vela.sh to /usr/bin/tensorflow-lite-2.12.1/examples in rootfs and run the following command:

```bash
/usr/bin/tensorflow-lite-2.12.1/examples/ML_vela.sh 1
```

6. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 18 shows the measurement results when this use case applies to the i.MX 93 processor.
