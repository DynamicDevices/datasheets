# 4.2  i.MX 93 power mode overview

The i.MX 93 supports the following power modes:

• **Run mode:** In this mode, the Cortex-A55 CPU is active and running. Some portions can be shut off for power saving.

• **Low-power run mode:** This mode is defined as a Low-power run mode with all external power rails on. In this mode, all unnecessary power domains (MIX) can be off. The AONMIX and internal modules, such as OSC24M/PLL, are an exception in this mode. The Cortex CPU in AONMIX handles all the computing and data processing. Cortex-A55 is powered down and DRAM can be in self-refresh/retention mode.
