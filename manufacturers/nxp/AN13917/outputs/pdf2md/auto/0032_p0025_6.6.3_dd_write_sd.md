# 6.6.3  DD_WRITE_SD

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.
4. The maximum amount of data the kernel reads ahead for a single file is set to 512 kB.

To measure the power consumption of DD_WRITE_SD, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh.
3. Copy dd_write.sh on the SD partition and run.
4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 22 shows the measurement results when this use case applies to the i.MX 93 processor.
