# 7.9  Distribution of workloads

The concept of distributed workloads is to review the system requirements and determine which SoC block is best suited for each task. By spreading the workload, the system can return to the "Idle" state sooner. This process applies to multicore distributions and functions that suit the CM33 core or ML engine. System designers must ensure that the design uses the optimal cores for the specific workloads or tasks, on the i.MX 93 for maximum efficiency. While often easier said than done, it does provide significant power savings if the system can return to the low-power state faster (run fast and idle).
