6.7.10  Battery
BBSM mode of the i.MX 93 processor is a Low-power mode where only the power for the BBSM domain
remains on.
When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:
1. All power supplies except NVCC_BBSM_1P8 are off externally.
2. The secure real-time clock (SRTC) is maintained and is running.
3. Tamper logic is retained.
4. SNVS is at 1.8 V DGO (VBAT input: 3 V).
5. All clocks and PLLS in CA55 and LPAV are turned off.
To configure and run the use case, the steps are as follows:
1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb in CA55.
2. Press the ON/OFF key for 3 seconds.
3. Measure the power and record the results.
Table 33 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
