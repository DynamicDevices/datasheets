# 6.3.2  Audio low-bus playback (gplay)

For this use case, the audio file is a WAV file with a 24 bit and a 32 kHz sample rate. CA55 handles audio decoding, I2S, and audio codec.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to 1.4 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 625 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

## Measuring Power Consumption

To measure the power consumption of the audio low-bus playback, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk-ld.dtb`.
2. Run `DDRC_625MTS_setup.sh` (625 MT/s data rate), see Section 8.
3. Run `gplay_audio.sh`:

```bash
gplay-1.0 Mpeg1L3_44kHz_128kbps_s_Ed_Rush_Sabotage_mplayer.mp3
```

> **Note:** Prepare your own MP3 file. To obtain similar results in this document, ensure that the audio bit rate is about 128 kbit/s.

4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 14 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
