# 1  Introduction

This application note is intended to help system designers to create power-optimized systems. It describes how to measure the current drain of the i.MX 93 application processor on an NXP i.MX 93 EVK board through different use cases.

**Note:**
Some use case binaries can be found in AN13917SW.

Users can choose the appropriate power supply domains for the i.MX 93 processor and become familiar with the expected processor power consumption in various scenarios.

**Note:** The reported results are not guaranteed because the data presented in this application note is based on empirical measurements performed on a small sample size.
