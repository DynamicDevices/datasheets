# 7.12  Nominal drive mode

The NXP-supplied Linux BSP GA release configures the system to run in Overdrive mode (ODM) by default. This Overdrive mode and associated performance are not necessary for some user applications. Users can transition to Nominal or Low-drive mode as defined in the i.MX 93 data sheet instead.
