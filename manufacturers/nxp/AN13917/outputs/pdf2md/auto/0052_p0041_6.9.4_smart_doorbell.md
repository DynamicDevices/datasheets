# 6.9.4  Smart doorbell

For this use case, a doorbell is simulated with a camera. The video stream collected on the doorbell can be sent to other devices through the network. The AP1302 MIPI camera is used to record the video. The video is 480p, encoded in H.264 format, and then the RTP protocol transfers the video. On the host PC, video playback software VLC helps to open the session description protocol (SDP) file. By opening the file, the stream video can be viewed.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the smart doorbell, the steps are as follows:

1. Download the ap1302 firmware from ONSemiconductor, and rename it as ap1302.fw.
2. Copy ap1302.fw to the target board under the path /lib/firmware/imx/camera/.
