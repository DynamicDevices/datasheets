# 6.8.2  2 x CA55 Stream + PXP + CM33 CoreMark + NPU

The state of the system, when the use case is running, is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The LCDIF and PXP are used for GUI rendering and display.
4. The CA55 is used for the Stream.
5. The CM33 is used for CoreMark and NPU.

To measure the power consumption of the 2 x CA55 Stream + PXP + CM33 CoreMark + NPU, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
2. Backup `/lib/firmware/ethosu_firmware`. Copy `ethosu_apps_rpmsg_coremark.out` to `/lib/firmware` and rename it to `ethosu_firmware`. For the other NPU-related cases, use the default one.
3. Copy the model named `mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_vela.tflite` to `/usr/bin/tensorflow-lite-2.12.1/examples`. The TensorFlow version in `ML_vela.sh` must be the same.
4. Run `setup_video.sh`.
5. Run the `streamcpy_loop.sh`, `PXP_test.sh`, and `ML_vela.sh` simultaneously.
6. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 35 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
