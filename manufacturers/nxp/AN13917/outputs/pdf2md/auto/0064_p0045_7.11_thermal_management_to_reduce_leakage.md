# 7.11  Thermal management to reduce leakage

Thermal management is also a key element of power reduction. As temperature increases, so does the SoC gate leakage current for each gate within the device. Millions of high-gate leakages add up when looking for the lowest power consumption. As explained earlier, with any power savings, the temperature of the SoC reduces, and the lifetime reliability of the device improves.

As each system is unique, the system designer must ensure that the operating temperature of the SoC is as low as possible to reduce the leakage current loss. If this temperature cannot be achieved from software controls, the designer must include a heat sink or other thermal management methods to remove the heat from the SoC.
