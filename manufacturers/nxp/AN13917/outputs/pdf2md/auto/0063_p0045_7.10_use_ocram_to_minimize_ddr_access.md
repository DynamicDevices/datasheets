# 7.10  Use OCRAM to minimize DDR access

To achieve significant power savings, load highly accessed code into the On-Chip RAM (OCRAM). As a result, both the i.MX 93 and the DDR memory current consumption reduces. Another advantage of using the OCRAM is a performance increase since DDR memory access time delays this code.
