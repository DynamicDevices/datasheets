# 6.1  Core benchmark use cases

The following use cases scenarios have been tested with Cortex A55 cores:

- Dhrystone
- CoreMark

## 6.1.1  Dhrystone

Dhrystone is a synthetic benchmark used to measure the integer computational performance of processors and compilers. The small size of the Dhrystone benchmark enables it to fit into the L1 cache and minimizes access to the L2 cache and DDR.

In this use case, the two Cortex-A55 cores perform the Dhrystone test. Because Dhrystone is a single thread benchmark, two instances have been started. All Cortex-A55 cores run the test in a loop at a frequency of 1.7 GHz.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The display is OFF.
4. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of Dhrystone, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh, see Section 8.
3. Run dhrystone_loop.sh:

```bash
while [ "1" == "1" ]; do
  taskset -c 0 ./dhry2 &
  taskset -c 1 ./dhry2
done
```

4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 8 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.

**Table 8 - Measurement results for i.MX 93-11x11-EVK_B_Dhrystone_loop (average value)**

This table presents the power consumption measurements for the Dhrystone benchmark running on the i.MX 93 processor evaluation board. The table includes measurements taken under the specific test conditions described above (CPU at 1.7 GHz, DDR at 3733 MT/s, display OFF, CM33 in reset hold). The data represents average values of power consumption during the continuous loop execution of the Dhrystone benchmark on both Cortex-A55 cores.
