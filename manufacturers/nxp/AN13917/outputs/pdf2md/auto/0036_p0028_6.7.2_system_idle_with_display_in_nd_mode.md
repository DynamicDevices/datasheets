# 6.7.2  System Idle with display in ND mode

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU default frequency is set to 1.4 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 2800 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption for the system Idle with display on ND mode with DDRC auto clock gating, the steps are as follows:

1. Connect the HDMI display to the board through the MIPI-to-HDMI converter card (IMX-MIPI-HDMI).
2. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
3. Run setup_video.sh.
4. To put the system into the ND mode, run the following command:

```bash
echo 1 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/mode
```

5. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 25 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
