# 6.7  Low-power mode use cases

The following Low-power mode use case scenarios have been tested:

- System Idle with display in OD mode with DDRC auto clock gating
- System Idle with display in ND mode
- System Idle with display in LD mode (DDR to half speed)
- System Idle with display in LD mode (DDR to lowest speed with SWFFC)
- System Idle with display in OD mode without DDRC auto clock gating
- System Idle with display in ND mode without DDRC auto clock gating
- System Idle with display in LD mode without DDRC auto clock gating (DDR to half speed)
- System Idle with display in LD mode without DDRC auto clock gating (DDR to lowest speed with SWFFC)
- System in DSM
- Battery

## 6.7.1  System Idle with display in OD mode with DDRC auto clock gating

The state of the system, when the use case is running, is as follows:

1. The CPU default frequency is set to 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption for the system Idle with display in OD mode with DDRC auto clock gating, the steps are as follows:

1. Connect the HDMI display to the board through the MIPI-to-HDMI converter card (IMX-MIPI-HDMI).
2. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
3. Run setup_video.sh.
4. The default mode is the OD mode.
5. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 24 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.

**Table 24. Measurement results for i.MX 93-11x11-EVK_B_System_idle_w_display_on_OD_mode_DDRC_auto_clock_gating (average value)**

This table presents power consumption measurement data for the i.MX 93 processor in System Idle mode with display active in OD (Overdrive) mode and DDRC auto clock gating enabled. The table includes columns for various power rails and domains, showing voltage levels, current draw, and total power consumption values averaged across the test scenario.
