# 6.7.8  System Idle without display in LD mode with DDRC auto clock gating (DDR to lowest speed with SWFFC)

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU default frequency is set to 0.9 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 625 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption for the system Idle without display on LD mode with DDRC auto clock gating (DDR to lowest speed with SWFFC), the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk-ld.dtb`.
2. Run `setup.sh`.
3. To put the system into the LD mode, DDR to the lowest speed with SWFFC, run the following command:

```bash
echo 3 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/mode
```

4. To enable `auto_clk_gating`, run the following command:

```bash
echo 256 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/auto_clk_gating
```

Where 256 implies the duration for DDR Idle to enter self; the unit is the clock cycle.

5. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 31 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
