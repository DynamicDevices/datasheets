# 6.9.2  Linux Suspend + CM33 in wait for interrupt

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The Linux OS is configured to be in Suspend mode.
2. The DDR is in Self-refresh mode.
3. The CM33 is in Wait for interrupt (WFI) mode.

To measure the power consumption of Linux Suspend + CM33 in WFI, the steps are as follows:

1. Copy `power_mode_switch_flexcan_coremark.bin` to bootpartition on SD card.
2. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
3. Stop in U-Boot.
4. Run:

```bash
setenv mmcargs $mmcargs clk_ignore_unused 
fatload mmc 0:1 0x80000000 power_mode_switch_flexcan_coremark.bin
cp.b 0x80000000 0x201e0000 0x10000;bootaux 0x1ffe0000 0
```

5. To boot to kernel, run `boot`.
6. To put the system into suspend, run the following command:

```bash
echo mem > /sys/power/state
```
