# 6.7.4  System Idle with display in LD mode (DDR to lowest speed with SWFFC)

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU default frequency is set to 0.9 GHz.
2. The DDR frequency is set to 625 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption for the system Idle with display on LD mode (DDR to lowest speed with SWFFC), the steps are as follows:

1. Connect the HDMI display to the board through the MIPI-to-HDMI converter card (IMX-MIPI-HDMI).
2. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk-ld.dtb.
3. Run setup_video.sh.
4. To put the system into the LD mode, DDR to the lowest speed with SWFFC, run the following command:

```bash
echo 3 > /sys/devices/platform/imx93-lpm/mode
```

5. Measure the power and record the result.

Table 27 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
