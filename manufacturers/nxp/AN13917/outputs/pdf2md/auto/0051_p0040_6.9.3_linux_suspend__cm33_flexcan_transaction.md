# 6.9.3  Linux Suspend + CM33 FlexCAN transaction

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The Linux OS is configured to be in Suspend mode.
2. The DDR is in Self-refresh mode.
3. The CM33 is in sending/receiving CAN frames.

To measure the power consumption of Linux Suspend + CM33 in WFI, the steps are as follows:

1. Prepare two i.MX 93 EVK boards, namely boards A and B.
2. Connect the CAN connector of the two boards together.
3. On both the boards, perform the following steps:
   a. Copy `power_mode_switch_flexcan_coremark.bin` to boot device.
   b. Boot the Linux image.
   c. Stop in U-Boot.
   d. Run:

```bash
setenv mmcargs $mmcargs clk_ignore_unused
fatload mmc 1:1 ${loadaddr} power_mode_switch_flexcan_coremark.bin;cp.b ${loadaddr} 0x201e0000 0x10000;bootaux 0x1ffe0000 0
fatload mmc ${mmcdev}:${mmcpart} ${fdt_addr_r} ${fdtfile};
fdt addr ${fdt_addr_r};
fdt rm /soc/bus@44000000/can@443a0000;
run mmcargs;
fatload mmc ${mmcdev}:${mmcpart} ${loadaddr} ${image};
run boot_os
```
