# 6.3.3  Video playback local (gplay)

For this use case, the i.MX 93 EVK board is connected to an HDMI display through the MIPI-to-HDMI converter card (IMX-MIPI-HDMI).

The video file used for playback is an MP4 file format compressed using the H.264 480 p resolution at 24 frames per second (fps). The audio encoding is AACL with a 44.1 kHz sample rate in a two-channel configuration.

**Note:** In this SoC, there is no hardware decoder, so a software decoder is used.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

## Measurement Procedure

To measure the power consumption of video playback local, the steps are as follows:

1. Connect the HDMI display to the board through the MIPI-to-HDMI converter card (IMX-MIPI-HDMI).
2. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
3. To put the system into Idle mode, run `setup_video.sh`. See Section 8.
4. Run `gplay_videoplayback.sh`:

```bash
gplay-1.0 ./480p24.mp4
```

**Note:** Prepare your own MP4 file. To obtain similar results, ensure that this file is 480 p with a 24-frame rate, bit rate of about 1200 kbit/s, and encoded in H.264 format.

5. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 15 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
