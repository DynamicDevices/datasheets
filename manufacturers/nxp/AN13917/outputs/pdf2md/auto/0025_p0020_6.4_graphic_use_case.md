# 6.4  Graphic use case

For this use case, the PXP is used to perform 2D operation.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

- The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
- The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
- The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the graphic, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup_video.sh.
3. Run PXP_test.sh, see Section 8.
4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 17 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.

**Table 17 - Measurement results for i.MX 93-11x11-EVK_B_PXP (average value)**

This table presents the power consumption measurement results when running the PXP (Pixel Pipeline) graphic use case on the i.MX 93 processor. The table contains average power consumption values across different power rails and operating conditions for the 2D graphics operation. The specific measurements and power rail values are shown in the table image above.
