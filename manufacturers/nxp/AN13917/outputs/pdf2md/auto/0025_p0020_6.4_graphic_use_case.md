# 6.4  Graphic use case

For this use case, the PXP is used to perform 2D operation.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

- The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
- The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
- The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the graphic, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup_video.sh.
3. Run PXP_test.sh, see Section 8.
4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 17 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.

| Rail label | Average voltage (V) | Average current (mA) | Average power (mW) | Sum of average powers (mW) | Zone 0 die temperature (°C) |
|------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| GROUP_DRAM lpd4x_vdd1 | 1.79 | 2.9 | 5.2 | 55.25 | 36 |
