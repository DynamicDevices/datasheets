# 7.3  DDRC auto clock gating

When the bus is idle after the number of cycles configured in the `ssi_idle_strap` field in the DDR BLK_CTRL module, the DDRC does auto clock gating to save power. This feature can be used to balance DDR subsystem performance and power significantly. The number of idle cycles before clock gating can be adjusted dynamically based on the actual use case to fine-tune the power saving.

In the i.MX 93, `auto_clk_gating` is used to enable the DDRC auto clock gating. Therefore, power is saved when there is no access to the DDR after the programmed idle count expires. "Write 0" disables the auto clock gating and the "write non-zero" value sets the `ssi_idle_strip` to this non-zero value and enable the auto clock gating. A value < 256 has some significant side effect for DDR performance, so a value >=256 is suggested when the user wants to enable it. When the auto clock gating is enabled, a high-resolution display like 1080 P 60 fps can flicker at lower DDR frequency. It is recommended not to adjust the `auto_clk_gating` when the display/NPU is running.
