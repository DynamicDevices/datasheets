# 6.2.2  memcpy

The memcpy use case is for evaluating the performance of a simple memory copy in various ways.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The size for the memory buffers is set to 1024 MB.
4. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of memcpy, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh, see Section 8.
3. Run memcpy_loop.sh:

```bash
while true; do
  buff_size=`cat /proc/meminfo | grep CmaFree | awk '{print$2}'`
  perf bench -f simple mem memcpy -l 20000 -s ${buff_size}KB
done
```

4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 11 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
