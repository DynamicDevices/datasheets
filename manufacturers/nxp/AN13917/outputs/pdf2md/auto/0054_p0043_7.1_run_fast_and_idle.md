# 7.1  Run fast and idle

NXP testing and various research have shown that for most customer use cases, the best power/energy management protocol is to run the cores at maximum speeds for the workload and then drop to the lowest power mode as soon as possible. This strategy cannot provide optimal energy savings for the use cases where constant data is being processed, for example, low-latency audio playback. However, this strategy does work for other standard workloads. Consider this trade-off for each application to quantify the overall effect on the system power/energy consumption.

Users must place the i.MX 93 into the Low-power mode as far as possible.
