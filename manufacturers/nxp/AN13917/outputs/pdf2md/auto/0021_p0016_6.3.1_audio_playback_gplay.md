# 6.3.1  Audio playback (gplay)

For this use case, the audio file is an MP3 file with a 128 kbit/s bit rate and a 44 kHz sample rate. CA55 handles audio decoding, I2S, and audio codec.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the audio playback, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
2. Run `setup.sh`, see Section 8.
3. Run `gplay_audio.sh`:

```bash
gplay-1.0 Mpeg1L3_44kHz_128kbps_s_Ed_Rush_Sabotage_mplayer.mp3
```

**Note:** Prepare your own MP3 file. To obtain similar results in this document, ensure that the audio bit rate is about 128 kbit/s.

4. Measure the power and record the results.
