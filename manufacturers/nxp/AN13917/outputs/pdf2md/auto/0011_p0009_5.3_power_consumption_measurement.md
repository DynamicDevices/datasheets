# 5.3  Power consumption measurement

To measure the i.MX 93 power consumption, the steps are as follows:

1. Connect a micro-USB cable between the host PC and the J1401 USB port on the MCIMX93-EVK board.
2. To start the monitor in the BCU path, run the following command:

```bash
bcu monitor -board=imx93evk11b1
```

3. Run the related use cases. These use cases are described under Section 6.
4. To reset the value, press "3" once the use case starts.
5. To switch measurement precision: mA/auto/uA, press "4". This step is optional.
6. Wait for 1 minute and record the data in the BCU.

The measurements are taken mainly for the power supply domains shown in Table 6. This table also provides a mapping between the power rails in BCU software, and the power supply domains in the i.MX 93 processor. For more information, download BCU.pdf.
