# 6.2.3  Stream

The stream benchmark is a simple synthetic benchmark program that measures the sustainable memory bandwidth (in MB/s) and the corresponding computation rate for simple vector kernels.

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. All phases, such as Copy, Scale, Add, and Triad, are included.
4. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.

To measure the power consumption of the stream, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh, see Section 8.
3. Run streamcpy_loop.sh:

```bash
while [ "1" == "1" ]; do
  taskset -c 0 stream -M 200M -N 1000 & 
  taskset -c 1 stream -M 200M -N 1000
done
```

4. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 12 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.

**Table 12 - Measurement results for i.MX 93-11x11-EVK_B_stream_loop (average value):**

This table presents the power consumption measurements for the stream benchmark use case on the i.MX 93 processor. The table includes measurements for different power rails and operating conditions. Key data includes voltage levels, current consumption, and total power consumption across various system components including VDD_SOC, VDD_ARM, NVCC_SD2, and other power domains. The measurements represent average values during the continuous execution of the stream benchmark with both CPU cores active at maximum frequency (1.7 GHz) and DDR running at 3733 MT/s.
