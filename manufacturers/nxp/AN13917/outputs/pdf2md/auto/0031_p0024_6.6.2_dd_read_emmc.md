# 6.6.2  DD_READ_eMMC

The state of the system, when the use case is running, is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.
4. The maximum amount of data the kernel reads ahead for a single file is set to 512 kB.

To measure the power consumption of DD_READ_eMMC, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh.
3. Make sure the file dd_obs_testfile exists and rename it to dd_ibs_testfile.
4. Copy dd_read_bs4096.sh on the eMMC partition and run.
5. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 21 shows the measurement results when this use case applies to the i.MX 93 processor.

**Table 21. Measurement results for i.MX 93-11x11-EVK_B_DD_READ_eMMC (average value)**

The image shows a table containing power measurement results for the DD_READ_eMMC use case on the i.MX 93-11x11-EVK board. The table presents average power consumption values across different voltage rails and operating conditions for this specific test scenario where data is read from eMMC storage using the dd command with a 4096-byte block size.
