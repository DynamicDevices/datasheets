# 6.6.2  DD_READ_eMMC

The state of the system, when the use case is running, is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The CM33 is in reset hold, waiting for the reset signal release.
4. The maximum amount of data the kernel reads ahead for a single file is set to 512 kB.

To measure the power consumption of DD_READ_eMMC, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Run setup.sh.
3. Make sure the file dd_obs_testfile exists and rename it to dd_ibs_testfile.
4. Copy dd_read_bs4096.sh on the eMMC partition and run.
5. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 21 shows the measurement results when this use case applies to the i.MX 93 processor.
