# 6.8  Stress test use cases

The following stress use case scenarios have been tested:

- 2 x CA55 Dhrystone + PXP + CM33 CoreMark + NPU
- 2 x CA55 Stream + PXP + CM33 CoreMark + NPU

## 6.8.1  2 x CA55 Dhrystone + PXP + CM33 CoreMark + NPU

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The CPU frequency is set to the maximum value of 1.7 GHz.
2. The DDR data rate is set to 3733 MT/s.
3. The LCDIF and PXP are used for GUI rendering and display.
4. The CA55 is used for the Dhrystone.
5. The CM33 is used for CoreMark and NPU.

To measure the power consumption of the 2 x CA55 Dhrystone + PXP + CM33 CoreMark + NPU, the steps are as follows:

1. Boot the Linux image with imx93-11x11-evk.dtb.
2. Backup /lib/firmware/ethosu_firmware. Copy ethosu_apps_rpmsg_coremark.out to /lib/firmware and rename it to ethosu_firmware. For the other NPU-related cases, use the default one.
3. Copy the model named mobilenet_v1_1.0_224_quant_vela.tflite to /usr/bin/tensorflow-lite-2.12.1/examples. The TensorFlow version in ML_vela.sh must be the same.
4. Run setup_video.sh.
5. Run the dhrystone_loop.sh, PXP_test.sh, and ML_vela.sh simultaneously.
6. Measure the power and record the results.

Table 34 shows the measurement results when this use case is applied to the i.MX 93 processor.
