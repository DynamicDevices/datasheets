# 7.5  Core VFS and system bus scaling

Applying VFS for the Arm cores and scaling (not dynamic) the frequencies of the NOC, AXI, AHB, and IPG system bus clocks can significantly reduce the power consumption of the VDD_SOC domains. However, the operation of system frequency reduction causes longer access times to the DDR, which can increase the energy consumption for specific use cases. Consider this trade-off for each mode to quantify the overall effect on the system power consumption.
