The following product use case scenarios have been tested:

• Linux Suspend + CM33 Coremark (TCM)
• Linux Suspend + CM33 in WFI
• Linux Suspend + CM33 FlexCAN transaction
• Smart doorbell

## 6.9.1  Linux Suspend + CM33 CoreMark (TCM)

When the use case is running, the state of the system is as follows:

1. The Linux OS is configured to be in Suspend mode.
2. The DDR is in Self-refresh mode.
3. The CM33 is running CoreMark.

To measure the power consumption of Linux Suspend + CM33 CoreMark (TCM), the steps are as follows:

1. Copy `power_mode_switch_flexcan_coremark.bin` to bootpartition on SD card.
2. Boot the Linux image with `imx93-11x11-evk.dtb`.
3. Stop in U-Boot.
4. Run:

```
setenv mmcargs $mmcargs clk_ignore_unused
fatload mmc 1:1 0x80000000
 power_mode_switch_flexcan_coremark.binpower_mode_switch_coremark.bin;cp.b 0x80000000
 0x201e0000 0x10000;bootaux 0x1ffe0000 0
```
